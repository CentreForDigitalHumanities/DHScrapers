The author was all over the place. I typically read books quickly and this one took me just about a month because everytime I picked it up, I would fall asleep.

I could not relate to any of the characters. I was halfway through the book when a little bit of action happened, but even still it wasn't all that great.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of Paul, The Dinner is about a family with a secret they are meeting to discuss at a fancy restaurant. Completely unrealistic! I never felt like I knew where Paul was going in the story. The minute attention to detail was agonizing as each meal for each course of the dinner was reviewed. Paul has some kind of mental illness and as he introduces different pieces about others in the family he self invokes, HIPPA, which is weird in a book leaving readers to wonder what happened with many of the characters. I didn't like him at all as a character. By the end of the book, I was confused with lots of questions...primarily, what was the point of the story? Additionally, it was extremely drawn out. Best part of the book was being done with it. i'm interested to discuss at our next book club meeting to see what others thought.<br /><br />Many people compared this to Gone Girl and I completely disagree. Gone Girl was action packed from start to end and this book certainly was not. </span>  <a data-text-id="17955093329083107095" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review560934704">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link560934704" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=560934704&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_560934704'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/560934704?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_560934704' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_579699025" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/579699025" />    <a title="Nada" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/6479785-nada"><img alt="Nada" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1393189826p2/6479785.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/579699025?book_show_action=false">Apr 03, 2013</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Nada" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Nada" href="/user/show/6479785-nada">Nada</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>            </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer579699025" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer15835014571085695578">Review first published on my blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://memoriesfrombooks.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-dinner.html" rel="nofollow">http://memoriesfrombooks.blogspot.com...</a><br /><br />The Dinner takes place over the course of one evening - one dinner shared among two couples.

Serge and Babette. Paul and Claire. Over the course of the dinner, much is revealed about the dynamics of the two couples and about the relationship of brothers Serge and Paul. Both couples have children, and the dinner revolves around an event involving their fifteen year old sons.<br /><br />The book is written as a first person narrative with Paul as the narrator. The setting is Amsterdam. The central issue is that the two couples' sons have committed a senseless act that has serious legal ramifications. The two couples differ in their approach to this issue. For the bulk of the book, they dance around the issue and parry back and forth over the dinner.<br /><br />The conversation brings out serious issues in the relationships between the two brothers. One suffers from mental illness that causes violent bursts of temper. The other is submerged in political machinations and election maneuverings. The two wives bring their own perspectives and agendas.<br /><br />I found the book disturbing and difficult to read. The characters are not likable. The parental approach to the trouble the boys have caused is disturbing. The first person narrative makes the book more difficult; perhaps, a different perspective or different narrators might have added more depth to the story. Overall, this is one dinner I wish I had skipped.</span>  <a data-text-id="15835014571085695578" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review579699025">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link579699025" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=579699025&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_579699025'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/579699025?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_579699025' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_1010777868" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1010777868" />    <a title="Diana" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/1219006-diana"><img alt="Diana" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1430807472p2/1219006.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/1010777868?book_show_action=false">Jul 29, 2014</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Diana" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Diana" href="/user/show/1219006-diana">Diana</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>                  <div class="uitext greyText bookshelves">            Shelves:              <a class="actionLinkLite" href="/review/list/1219006-diana?shelf=bookclub">bookclub</a>          </div>    </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">                  <em>                    This review has been hidden because it contains spoilers.

Nope. Not even a little. Maybe it was lost in the translation from the original Dutch?<br /><br />The casual approach to two teens who killed a homeless person was terrible enough... but at the end? That poor adopted son, Beau... you know Claire instructed the boys (or at least Michael) to "solve the problem" and when Paul sees him come in covered in dirt, you know that innocent African kid is dead.<br /><br />The bit about Claire and the genetic test was very interesting, too - did she know her son was going to be a nut job because of Paul? and just not care? Did she think Paul would have wanted her to get an abortion so she lied about both parents consenting to the test? I'm not sure if this was a weird afterthought, but it didn't make me feel very different about any of the characters or the book itself.<br /><br />One star.

If it were presented as a character flaw I might go along? but not a disease, and not (this upset me terribly) a disease that can be detected in amniotic fluid. Most mental illness can't be determined by genetic testing, much less an amniotic fluid test.<br /><br />Eh, I shouldn't put the flaws of the book down to that. It was supposed to be a good psychological thriller. But not one character acted normally, humanly, rationally-- not even with animal instincts; like some dinner of aliens. I constantly wondered on what planet this would be normal.<br /><br />The narrator was obnoxious. How many times did he refuse to name a place or go into detail. Evil and psychopathic characters I don't mind, but unbelievable and obnoxious ones I do. Speaking of unbelievable, Serge is OK eating with the brother who bloodied him? I suppose Claire's violence at the end is more understandable, then. Serge is not intelligent &amp; will probably forget it.<br /><br />The ending didn't solve anything, was less believable than the rest of the book (which is saying a lot). <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />Heh, I should've just linked to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/693856047?book_show_action=false&amp;page=3" rel="nofollow">this review</a>.</span>  <a data-text-id="4754974542511108668" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review929830602">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link929830602" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=929830602&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_929830602'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/929830602?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_929830602' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_1198136522" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1198136522" />    <a title="Anne" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/29972585-anne"><img alt="Anne" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1505948486p2/29972585.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/1198136522?book_show_action=false">Feb 11, 2015</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Anne" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Anne" href="/user/show/29972585-anne">Anne</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>                  <div class="uitext greyText bookshelves">            Shelves:              <a class="actionLinkLite" href="/review/list/29972585-anne?shelf=my-books">my-books</a>          </div>    </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer1198136522" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer1883479366842156296">Horrible book!!

I think that is partially true, but that is not what bothered me. What was so awful was that the parents of Michel (Paul &amp; Claire) did not even seem to.think he did anything wrong! They kept trying to justify his actions and blame the victim. They just seemed like despicable human beings. Supposedly Paul had some sort of mental disorder that caused him to be a complete ass who regularly beat people up if they made him angry. The supposition was that his son inherited this from him. That does not explain his wife's behavior. Also, he chose to go off his medication that controlled his condition.<br /><br />I only finished to book because I read other reviews of how bad the ending was and I was curious. I will say I agree with the reviews about the horrible ending. It was not surprising given how bad the rest of the book was. This is the most scathing review I have ever written and I am honestly kind of mad at my sister for recommending this book.</span>  <a data-text-id="1883479366842156296" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review1198136522">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link1198136522" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=1198136522&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_1198136522'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/1198136522?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_1198136522' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_1794930378" class="review nosyndicate" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1794930378" />    <a title="Polly" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/1921515-polly"><img alt="Polly" src="https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_50x66-6a03a5c12233c941481992b82eea8d23.png" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/1794930378?book_show_action=false">Oct 26, 2016</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Polly" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Polly" href="/user/show/1921515-polly">Polly</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>            </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer1794930378" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer2626663090210908168">Ugh.

As the meal (and predictable plot line) moved forward and the characters became more hateful, I was tempted to toss the book aside. But it was short, so...read on i did. <br /><br />Brief pros: gave me an insight into the Dutch psyche and convoluted feelings about their form of government (or at least their weak elected officials and lowly world status). The bits about the waiter pointing to and elucidating the provenance of each bit of (tiny) food on the (large) plates was funny at first, but got old. <br /><br />Cons: Hateful characters to whom it's impossible to relate. I suspect the author was trying to challenge us on the nature of parenting and what people will do to protect their offspring, but honestly i didn't care whether the father, mother, and son all roasted in hell, by the end. The addition of an adopted African son seemed contrived and unnecessary; i don't think the plot would've changed one whit were he also Dutch. So much more to hate, but it's back to work for me. <br />Avoid this book unless you're utterly bored or desperate for reading material. in the latter case, you'd be better off cruising almost any blog post online. <br /></span>  <a data-text-id="2626663090210908168" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review1794930378">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link1794930378" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=1794930378&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_1794930378'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/1794930378?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_1794930378' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_857534359" class="review nosyndicate" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/857534359" />    <a title="Michelle Hart" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/27249531-michelle-hart"><img alt="Michelle Hart" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1491272274p2/27249531.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/857534359?book_show_action=false">Feb 17, 2014</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Michelle Hart" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Michelle Hart" href="/user/show/27249531-michelle-hart">Michelle Hart</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>                  <div class="uitext greyText bookshelves">            Shelves:              <a class="actionLinkLite" href="/review/list/27249531-michelle-hart?shelf=read-2014">read-2014</a>          </div>    </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer857534359" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer8167059838432005245">While the book does make you wonder how far you would go to protect family, there FAR too many questions left dangling.

By the end of the book, I didn't even care anymore. None of the characters are likable. I didn't care who knew what when and I didn't care how they all ended up. I just wanted the book finished. <br /><br />I personally found the 'I'm not going to tell you the specifics of _______' tactic that was repeated numerous times throughout the book to be incredibly annoying. I can only presume the author thought it cute or clever. It wasn't. Tell me, or don't, but don't say 'there was an illness, but I'm not going to tell you the name of it'. Certainly don't use the same I'm-so-coy tactic over and over about various subjects. That makes me say 'fine, don't tell me, I don't care anyway'.<br /><br />I thought the video was going to be an entirely different secret than it turned out to be. The reveal of the video's subject was a surprise to me. What the video turned out to be was an interesting plot twist. Unfortunately, that was the only interesting twist.<br /><br />The book could have been so good. The premise was good. The execution and conclusion?

It would be interesting to know what native readers think of it since it was written by a Dutch gentleman. I do not pretend to be familiar with the culture/differences in use of language. Thus, some of my dislike may stem from this lack of familiarity. No matter what the source, literature should be universal in it's scope. I found the conversations in the book to be disappointingly flat. I did not feel for the characters nor completely understand their points of view. The setting of the story is extremely odd. This family needs to meet to discuss family secrets, so where do they go? -Out to dinner. -Huh? Also, highly implausible that the father's tantrums? haven't caused the family more hardships. There are twists, but they are largely unimaginative. Of note, the "restaurant scene" is focused upon highly, though uninterestingly, in the first half of the book and then hurried through after "the main course". I don't agree with other reviews that I have read that describe this as a look into the lengths people will go to protect their families. I more saw it as a peek into the upbringing of a psychopath...It's no wonder his kid did what he did.<br /><br />I did actually make it through the book, but, as another reviewer put it,...I'd already spent the money.</span>  <a data-text-id="2004984483511181222" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review555882658">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link555882658" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=555882658&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_555882658'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/555882658?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_555882658' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_614544328" class="review nosyndicate" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/614544328" />    <a title="Tricia" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/423787-tricia"><img alt="Tricia" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1190838981p2/423787.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/614544328?book_show_action=false">May 13, 2013</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Tricia" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Tricia" href="/user/show/423787-tricia">Tricia</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>            </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer614544328" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer16430301313683746620">I am a pretty avid reader.

I had to force myself to finish it. <br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />1. My annoyance level rose every time the narrator would say something like "well I am not going to tell you the details of such and such...". I didn't find this clever at all, if that's what it was supposed to be. <br /><br />2. I don't have kids so I really cannot fathom the concept of allowing them to get away with murder (literally) and insisting on protecting them from the repercussions. Just thinking about it now is making me angry.<br /><br />3. Clair and the narrator BOTH knew but never bothered to discuss with each other the potential of their son having psychiatric issues and just choose to ignore it instead of getting him help which could have prevented all of the hobo murdering (and did he murder the adopted cousin too??? Yet another thing the narrator decided he didn't want to tell us I suppose). This irritated me to no end.<br /><br />So I guess I just didn’t "get" The Dinner.</span>  <a data-text-id="16430301313683746620" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review614544328">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link614544328" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=614544328&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_614544328'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/614544328?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_614544328' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_869647462" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/869647462" />    <a title="Dan JK" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/14305378-dan-jk"><img alt="Dan JK" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1471238056p2/14305378.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/869647462?book_show_action=false">Mar 02, 2014</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Dan JK" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Dan JK" href="/user/show/14305378-dan-jk">Dan JK</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>                  <div class="uitext greyText bookshelves">            Shelves:              <a class="actionLinkLite" href="/review/list/14305378-dan-jk?shelf=not-worth-mentioning">not-worth-mentioning</a>,               <a class="actionLinkLite" href="/review/list/14305378-dan-jk?shelf=prom-night-dumpster-babies">prom-night-dumpster-babies</a>          </div>    </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer869647462" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer14650038631783824486">Waiter this novel is not what i ordered.

It does a horrible job at it in my opinion because it does not even remotely introduce me to a new possible perspective I have not thought up myself.<br /><br />I also have a hard time believing this novel was written as a satire or a satire holding any truth to the definition because Paul is psychologically unstable and therefore a unreliable narrator which automatically makes his actions ABSOLUTELY unknown or at most vague throughout the whole book. Also because of this we have very little idea of Claire's motives for her actions because we only know for sure she knows about the one big incident and not the other video. Therefore her acting as a (very common) overbearing helicopter parent (willing to do anything for her children) is not even remotely unbelievable.<br /><br />Oh Wait I just had a thought... I just blew my own mind and will probably blow yours too yours too. The novel itself was a satire of a satirical novel. ok i need to change it to 5 stars now.<br /><br /></span>  <a data-text-id="14650038631783824486" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review869647462">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link869647462" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=869647462&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_869647462'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/869647462?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_869647462' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_1172871889" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1172871889" />    <a title="Peter" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/23418160-peter"><img alt="Peter" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1424034104p2/23418160.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/1172871889?book_show_action=false">Jan 18, 2015</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Peter" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Peter" href="/user/show/23418160-peter">Peter</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>            </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer1172871889" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer10908766943906141104">The Dinner by Herman Koch is a novel that will either totally engage the reader or completely turn the reader off.

Clearly, I stand in the second camp.<br /><br />The premise and theme of the book has much to offer but my problem with the book lies in its delivery. To me, the characters were flat, wooden and unconvincing. This was, perhaps, a conscious decision by Koch to portray them as such, but for me the characters interfered with the story, rather than enhanced it. If Koch was attempting a "noir" feel to the book, that is fine, but the reader still must engage with the characters either to like them or dislike them. Can there be anything worse in a novel that not to care about any of its characters? <br /><br />The issue the parents in this novel must confront and deal with, while extreme, is still certainly valid, and the question of to what extent parents will go to forgive, or worse, ignore, the faults and transgressions of their children is an important one. Nevertheless, in this novel the gradual unveiling of the crime, the cover up and the related background of the story are not enough to give much satisfaction to the reading experience. <br /><br />Overall, the novel seemed to lurch towards its conclusion, which had some promise as to a twist ending, but it left me unsatisfied.</span>  <a data-text-id="10908766943906141104" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review1172871889">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link1172871889" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=1172871889&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_1172871889'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/1172871889?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_1172871889' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_1703831261" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1703831261" />    <a title="Jay Tate" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/37572919-jay-tate"><img alt="Jay Tate" src="https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/1703831261?book_show_action=false">Jul 20, 2016</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Jay Tate" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Jay Tate" href="/user/show/37572919-jay-tate">Jay Tate</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>            </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer1703831261" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer12080707759448112162">Was this worse than Gone Girl?

Instead, I will refer to things eight times and then move on. If you'd like, you can skip 2-3 pages and pick up right where you are - you won't miss much if you do. Did I tell you I really like my wife? She's nice. And I used to teach. And the waiter is bugging me. And I would nail my sis-in-law in a heartbeat, but I really like my wife. My brother wouldn't mind - after all, he'd definitely nail my wife if the waiter weren't taking so long. I wonder if my sis-in-law wants to nail my wife, too. There's a visual! I'm all in.

Opposite ends of the parental spectrum, one wants them to confess while the other will stop at nothing to keep it secret. All of this plays out over the course of the worst dinner ever. <br /><br />I get that the author was trying to show the complexity of family interactions and how we really don't know what we would do until faced with a no win situation. However, the characters behave in such odd ways, were terribly unlikable and although I can understand the writers purpose, I just can't get around the convenience of the plot. With the single point of view the narrator, we are only able to experience all these moving parts from his perspective only. Combined with odd flashbacks and the ending seems as if the writer was trying to prove a point but forgot to let the reader know.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it a D. </span>  <a data-text-id="9268371927222052264" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review896554132">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link896554132" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=896554132&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_896554132'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/896554132?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_896554132' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_660008592" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/660008592" />    <a title="Jennifer" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/46700-jennifer"><img alt="Jennifer" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1180539967p2/46700.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/660008592?book_show_action=false">Jul 06, 2013</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Jennifer" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Jennifer" href="/user/show/46700-jennifer">Jennifer</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>                  <div class="uitext greyText bookshelves">            Shelves:              <a class="actionLinkLite" href="/review/list/46700-jennifer?shelf=mysterythriller">mysterythriller</a>,               <a class="actionLinkLite" href="/review/list/46700-jennifer?shelf=icky-people-making-icky-choices">icky-people-making-icky-choices</a>          </div>    </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer660008592" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer837955555332384608">Quite a nasty piece of work; probably the most misanthropic thing I've ever read.

The book functions mainly for shock value -- what one reviewer described as a 300 page troll. <br /><br />*spoilers*<br /><br />This is all dependent on the reader suspending disbelief enough to buy highly unlikely and contrived behavior that doesn't resemble anything actual people do (i.e. going to a public restaurant to discuss a crime cover up to name just one.) The mysterious genetic illness and prenatal detection of psychopathy is utter b.s. Plus the characters' amorality and lack of any realistic legal response to their actions renders the "how far would you go to protect your children?" question moot. The question the book really poses is more along the lines of "how far would you go for your children IF you were total psychopaths AND ALSO there were no social repercussions for your violent actions whatsoever."

I really started to hate the book when Claire confessed that she preferred her husband better when he was off his medication and prone to uncontrollable verbal and violent outburst. I was pretty sure that at that point the story could not get any more distributing, but then Claire goes and gives her son crate blanche to do what ever he needs to his cousin so the cousin will stop blackmailing him. Umm... What?? I get that Claire and Paul wanted to keep their son out of jail, but seriously, they were willing to push not one, but two horrible violent acts under the rug and they were ok with their son killing his cousin??

The gag - well, I assume it's meant to be a gag - is that the parents are even more misanthropic and dysfunctional than their offspring. The principal protagonist is a whining, bitter, violent, hateful thug and his wife is not much better. His brother - wannabe next PM of Holland - is a vacuous narcissist and only his wife demonstrates even a hint of humanity.<br /><br />I assume this is intended to be a black comedy highlighting the amorality of the middle classes, particularly when it comes to protecting their children. It's black, but it ain't funny. One tone - relentlessly nasty - with nothing that connects any character to anyone you've ever known. <br /><br />Yuck.</span>  <a data-text-id="14157956846733072493" href="#"

Satire or not, Paul's whiny, egotistical, and semi-narcissistic nature bothered me. The plot reminded me of something out of an M. Night Shyamalan film. Not signs, or that one with Sam Jackson either. Probably The Village. Yeah, that one. Pretty fitting, seeing that many people enjoyed that movie and many people despised it. The characters all bothered me, as well as the overall attitude of the novel. I know the author probably made them pretentious, unlikable ass hats on purpose, so hats off to him for doing a great job in generating my hatred. I just couldn't find anything to like in this book. <br /><br />The ending bothered me.

He sounded intelligent and engaging, so I reconsidered reading this. Big mistake.<br /><br />It was extremely dull. Not one paragraph held my attention or engaged me in any way. Nothing happens , all the characters are bores and amoral, the plot is plodding, the writing workmanlike at best. It would be definitely the worst book I have read in the last 12 months if it were not for the yawn extravaganza that was Gone Girl. At least this was short and didn't irritate the hell out of me. Will not be rereading and would not recommend to anyone.

To make matters worse, I had initially picked up the book since it was regularly compared to , and recommended for lovers of , Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. I saw none of the GG suspense reflected in The Dinner; there is no doubt who committed the crime, and almost no doubt that the perpetrators would skate away from their responsibilities in the end. It was all about what skeevy plan these degenerates would put in motion to get there. All in all... this book was like a Big Mac. I finished it quickly, yep..... but I didn't enjoy it and just want to purge it almost immediately. </span>  <a data-text-id="11466815110940230361" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review1614151883">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link1614151883" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=1614151883&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_1614151883'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/1614151883?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_1614151883' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_855920174" class="review nosyndicate" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/855920174" />    <a title="Jenn" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/929679-jenn"><img alt="Jenn" src="https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_50x66-6a03a5c12233c941481992b82eea8d23.png" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/855920174?book_show_action=false">Feb 15, 2014</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Jenn" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Jenn" href="/user/show/929679-jenn">Jenn</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>            </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer855920174" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer14754540161504222479">I was only able to make it about 25% of the way through this book.

I know their sons did something (cuz that's the whole premise of the book), but I have no clue what, because it has not even been hinted at at this point (except that there's something on the one kid's phone about it). I can tolerate hateful protagonists, and kind of get a kick out of deceptive narrators (adds to the twists and turns). But I cannot tolerate boring. After realizing that I had zoned out and actually missed several pages -- due to the excessive boringness -- for the 5th or 6th time, I gave up and put the book down (and I never do that)</span>  <a data-text-id="14754540161504222479" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review855920174">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link855920174" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=855920174&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_855920174'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/855920174?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_855920174' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_1207982019" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1207982019" />    <a title="Barbara Ab" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/27169333-barbara-ab"><img alt="Barbara Ab" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1522602913p2/27169333.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/1207982019?book_show_action=false">Feb 22, 2015</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Barbara Ab" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Barbara Ab" href="/user/show/27169333-barbara-ab">Barbara Ab</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>            </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer1207982019" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer12356010761016157506">Personally, for me, reading this book was a complete waste of time (read during a sleepless night).

The general topic was already known and of not interest to me. The developing of the plot is terribly boring with a dysfunctional father figure being depicted by his personal memories during an annoying description of the dinner (restaurant and each course). It is not about actually teenagers with problems, but parents with problems and a society who do not have the courage to protect people in the name of “fair correctness” (a person with a disorder who can become dangerous should be restricted no matter what… ). The craziness of the story is that the one who should be in an asylum is the leading character who succeeds at the end of the story with his hypocrite wife. The figure of a politician who wanted to report his son for committing a crime and giving up his political career on the contrary seems to be the only to blame. I know a lot of people who justify everything as long as it comes to their own benefit, so I was only bored by this reading about people and society hypocrisy. </span>  <a data-text-id="12356010761016157506" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review1207982019">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link1207982019" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=1207982019&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_1207982019'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/1207982019?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_1207982019' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_1625295198" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1625295198" />    <a title="Brian Grover" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/16026178-brian-grover"><img alt="Brian Grover" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1362025929p2/16026178.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/1625295198?book_show_action=false">Apr 30, 2016</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Brian Grover" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Brian Grover" href="/user/show/16026178-brian-grover">Brian Grover</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>            </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer1625295198" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer7557424467306266715">I have been reading books for as many of my 40 years on this Earth as I can remember, and it's safe to say I've never hated a book more than I hated this.

I think he's a hack writer, regardless of the subject matter. I was so offended by the back jacket blurb from the WSJ review that called it "A European Gone Girl" that I googled the review, and - this is funny - it's a lukewarm review that doesn't make any reference to Gone Girl at all.

At the end the reader is left with nothing; I had the same empty, despairing feeling I get when reading about flash mobs or cruelty to animals in the newspaper. Our book group did spend more time on this one than most other books, exploring how we as parents would deal with a psychopathic offspring. Thankfully most of us will never be in quite this position; however it's not hard to imagine that we wouldn't behave like the parent characters in the book, condoning or even helping to cover up a brutal murder.</span>  <a data-text-id="13010848968873026941" href="#" onclick="swapContent($(this));; return false;">...more</a>          </span>        </div>      <div class="reviewFooter uitext buttons">          <tr class="no_border feedFooterReview" id="update_comment_stuff_Review602802410">  <td colspan="2">    <div class="updateActionLinks">        <a class="right flag" rel="nofollow" id="flag_link602802410" title="Flag this review as inappropriate." href="/flagged/new?resource_id=602802410&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F15797938-the-dinner">flag</a>      <span class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_602802410'><a rel="nofollow" class="jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F15797938-the-dinner">Like</a></span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href="/review/show/602802410?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=10">see review</a>    </div>    <div id='comments_for_review_602802410' style='display: none;'></div>  </td></tr>      </div>  </div>  <div class="clear"></div></div>    </div>  </div>    <div class="elementListBrownSeparator"></div>  <div class="friendReviews elementListBrown" >    <div class="section">      <div id="review_1028228266" class="review" itemprop="reviews" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">  <link itemprop="url" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1028228266" />    <a title="Amber Koppenhofer" class="left imgcol" href="/user/show/5037788-amber-koppenhofer"><img alt="Amber Koppenhofer" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1424669099p2/5037788.jpg" /></a>  <div class="left bodycol">    <div class="reviewHeader uitext stacked">        <a class="reviewDate createdAt right" href="/review/show/1028228266?book_show_action=false">Aug 16, 2014</a>      <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">        <a title="Amber Koppenhofer" class="user" itemprop="url" name="Amber Koppenhofer" href="/user/show/5037788-amber-koppenhofer">Amber Koppenhofer</a>      </span>        rated it        <span class=" staticStars notranslate" title="did not like it"><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p10">did not like it</span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span><span size="15x15" class="staticStar p0"></span></span>                  <div class="uitext greyText bookshelves">            Shelves:              <a class="actionLinkLite" href="/review/list/5037788-amber-koppenhofer?shelf=novel">novel</a>          </div>    </div>        <div class="reviewText stacked">              <span id="reviewTextContainer1028228266" class="readable"              >            <span id="freeTextContainer14952587553484607798">Sick, twisted, ridiculously ambiguous. . . there is not a whole lot to like about this book.
