                                to describe how irritated and ripped off I felt by this book.<br />To compare it to
                                <i>The Slap</i> (by Australian author Christos Tsiolkas) is such a joke. The characters
                                in that book were so well written and, while not always likeable (in fact some were
                                really icky), they were believable. And it explored the underlying issues and fallout
                                from the "event" that the book gets its name from.<br />I felt like the The Dinner was a
                                cheap stunt designed to make the reader feel like they had explored something deep, dark
                                and dangerous. It is white-bread, middle class, lite-lit of the worst kind.</span> <a

                                going to leave my review simple for many reasons- 1) You don't need me to tell you what
                                this book is about because there are lots of other people explaining the plot on
                                Goodreads, and they will do it much better than me (writing down my thoughts has never
                                been my forte)... 2) I have just started to voice my opinions on here, and my thoughts
                                on this book would make me sound like a " raving, people hating, I weep for the future"
                                kind of gal...and finally 3) If I get into my feelings of THE DINNER I will probably
                                give something away (since I don't know how to use the spoiler warning yet). I feel to
                                get the most enjoyment out of reading it, you really should go in blind.<br /></span> <a

                                kind of book that you remember as being <b>"clever"</b> and <b>"twisted"</b> but never
                                rush out to recommend. It's a book you find it hard to say isn't "good", but at the same
                                time you weren't blown away. And, though it may be about a dinner, it just isn't that
                                delicious.<br /><br />The whole story consists of one dinner at one of those overpriced
                                restaurants where you get a tiny morsel of food in the centre of your plate. Two couples
                                are at this meal - the narrator (Paul), his politician brother (Serge Lohman), and their
                                wives (Claire and Babette). Through little flashbacks and side stories, details and
                                vagueness, it becomes clear that there's a dark side to this get together and our
                                narrator might not be so reliable.<br /><br />It's a book about many things: mental
                                illness, dehumanization, middle class people and the coveted notion of a "happy family".
                                I particularly liked how Koch explored the ways in which <b>subtle language changes can
                                    be used to dehumanize someone</b>. Like calling a drunk person an "alcoholic" so
                                that's what they become - defined by their drunken state, no longer human, deserving of
                                everything they get.<br /><br /><b>It's a book that gets darker and darker</b>. And,
                                despite the scope of the novel being relatively small, it remains compelling. The
                                narrator's disdain for his pretentious brother and the general faff of "posh"
                                restaurants is amusing.<br /><br />Though I think, most of all, this novel has a severe
                                lack of believability and I found it hard to take seriously. Not because I don't believe
                                people are this morally bankrupt - not that at all - but there's a certain farcical
                                nature to the characters' actions. Would they really go out to eat at a restaurant when
                                having a discussion like this? Would Claire really react the way she did at the end
                                (before leaving the restaurant)?<br /><br /><a

                                happening.<br /><br />What about if it was your son and he was a killer? We all know
                                this happens in gangs too. We all wonder if it is what happens in the families of serial
                                killers.<br /><br />This is a hypothetical book, one of conjectures. It leads you slowly
                                through the action, at each stage asking you to question yourself, do you find this
                                acceptable, would you do this yourself, what kind of moral action do you expect (or not)
                                from private and public citizens? It asks where responsibility lies and how much nurture
                                v nature is responsible for our ethical conduct. It is an onion book, slowly slowly
                                peeling the skin and the layers until you get to, through tears, the seed, the seed
                                which could grow and form a new generation. A book of horrors. It's a what-if book and
                                one very apposite for the times.<br /><br />I started to read the book in print but it
                                was very slow indeed. Later I understood why there was such a need for a big build-up
                                but it was hard going and I gave it up for the audio book which had a wonderful narrator
                                that brought the character of Paul, the raconteur and only voice of the story to life.
                                <br /><br />At first I thought the ending, a psychological excuse was a cop-out but then
                                without it the book would have not involved the narrator (and his wife) quite so
                                intimately.<br /><br />People have said that the characters were not likeable, true.
                                Well generally that does make it hard to enjoy a book, but not this one. If the
                                characters had been likeable it wouldn't have been a 5-star read because then they would
                                have been like us and this is never going to happen in our lives. I
                                hope.<br />_______________<br /><br />If you've read the book and thought nothing like
                                that could ever really happen, read the <a

                                secret contempt of all things “weak” or “inferior”—formulated into an ideology and
                                informing violent reactions—is basically, for all intents and purposes, fascist. The
                                narrator Paul Lohman, and his wife Claire, unlikeable and repulsive that they end up
                                being in the novel, make decisions that at first might seem unbelievable, until their
                                history is further revealed. The fascist beliefs only become clear towards the end of
                                the book. <br /><br />Interestingly, the concept of "happiness" is a running theme
                                throughout the book. In the beginning, the narrator Paul quotes 'Anna Karenina' when he
                                says that, "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own
                                way." As Paul rails against elite society and the idea of "keeping up appearances," he
                                and his family do just that: they believe in fictions that will keep them, on the
                                surface, "happy." Yet, as "unhappy" and chilling realities unfold, page by page he
                                constantly evokes how happy they are, even as the actions prove Tolstoy's claim. And,
                                like Tolstoy warns, they are "unhappy" in a very unique way.<br /><br />Though, the book
                                leaves you with an icky feeling, it is somehow very enjoyable. It might have something
                                to do with the impulse to view the world through the eyes of someone we would never want
                                to be. It's voyeuristic, but you can't look away. In the end, we might say to ourself,
                                "At least I'm not THAT screwed up."</span> <a data-text-id="16205119265179632898"

                                achieve an attention-grabbing, gripping and intriguing read in this book. It is very
                                well written and translated. I was truly hooked from page one right up until the end.
                                The setting, i.e. the restaurant, works exceptionally well...a setting which we think
                                and imagine will provide intimacy and an appropriate platform for discussion. The
                                setting is an extremely important aspect in this book, because as each course arrives
                                for our diners, our own appetite, hunger and curiosity increase for the unfolding story.
                                Consequently, as each course is served, we are faced with the interruption of the waiter
                                on numerous occasions, explaining the dishes of choice to our four diners. Paul, the
                                narrator of the story becomes increasingly impatient with these interruptions and we the
                                reader do too, not because they are not highly complimentary and a necessary side dish
                                to the story, they are, but they serve to prolong our suspense and anticipation and
                                allow an extremely subtle tension to build . As a result, rather than receive the story
                                in one great dish, we are served it in nibbles and sips, finger-food as such. For me,
                                this was one of the best aspects of the book. This structure really worked superbly.
                                There are no likeable characters in the book and our narrator is totally unreliable, two
                                of my favourite features of a good read. The discussions at the dinner table incorporate
                                a number of themes for debate both for our diners and for us, the reader, and are not
                                only limited to the central crime. The plot in the story really brings to mind certain
                                questions for the reader, how far would we go to protect our children, what actions and
                                decisions would we take or what actions and decisions would we not take, in essence, how
                                far would we go, as parents, to protect the ones we love and cherish? This is indeed
                                dark and gritty but a wonderful and highly entertaining read.<br /><br />Highly
                                recommended if you like contemporary fiction, most especially books with unreliable
                                narrators. This book is also an ideal choice for Book Clubs, providing most entertaining
                                and interesting discussion and opinion topics. One of my favourite reads of 2013 so

                                the fact that these entitled kids hurt multiple people because they thought it was fun.
                                I hated that the parents were willing to cover it up, even when they discovered it was a
                                pattern. I hated that the father knew he had a mental illness, that had probably been
                                passed on to his son, but he just found it funny. I hated that the one person who wanted
                                to come clean and do the right thing was presented as an egocentric buffoon. Maybe it
                                isn't that I need characters that I like. Maybe it's that I want to know that there is a
                                moral compass out there. This book was filled with psychopaths with no redeeming
                                qualities. <br />I absolutely cannot recommend it.</span> <a

                                LIBRARY.<br /><br />Ahem. Now that I got <i>that</i> out of the way...<br /><br />The
                                book is clever, created in the framework of a dinner at a fine dining restaurant. The
                                sections of the book follow the courses, from <i>Aperitif</i> all the way to
                                <i>Digestif</i>. It takes place in Amsterdam, in an overpriced, hoity-toity restaurant,
                                with two couples who are there to discuss their misbehaving sons.<br /><br />The
                                narrator is funny, snarky, and is our tour guide through the evening. Koch uses
                                delightful sleight of hand throughout the book until the final reveal of what's what,
                                and who's who. He turns the reader into a voyeuristic snoop - I mean, don't we all
                                thrill a little when watching a nasty scene erupt at someone else's table? No? Just
                                me?<br /><br />There are a few weaknesses here, worth mentioning. I found it a little
                                hard to believe that the couples would decide to discuss their sons in a public place,
                                given the 'delicate' subject matter. Also, there are biological explanations given for
                                bad behaviour that I didn't 100% buy. (Later, I came to realise that the "syndrome"
                                described in the book is a metaphor for pathological entitlement which gets passed down
                                from parent to child by a lifetime of examples.) But Koch's writing was strong enough to
                                make me take a morsel, and then another, and before I knew it, I'd finished all courses
                                a pretty happy customer.<br /><br />Many compare this to <i>Gone Girl</i>. From where I
                                sit, this book borrows more from <i>Crime and Punishment</i> - shining a light on the
                                moral elitism of those who believe they can decide that some lives are worth more than
                                others. The entitlement of some people to do as they please, regardless of the
                                consequences. Those who respond with a frightening smile or laugh in the face of a
                                ghastly deed done to someone who "deserved it". And, even more chilling, enabling the
                                next generation to be this way.<br /><br />It's dark and it's awful, but it didn't take
                                my appetite away... I'm sure to read more by Herman Koch.</span> <a

                                sociopath as well.<br /><br />You get the idea that something is wrong with our
                                narrator, Paul, early on. He loves the movies DELIVERANCE and STRAW DOGS and he often
                                fantasizes about punching people and killing them.<br /><br />It's only later that you
                                realize that he has put multiple people in the hospital.<br /><br />And it's not until
                                very close to the end of the novel that you realize his wife is just as bad as he is.
                                Until then you have a hope or a sympathy that perhaps she is a good
                                person.<br /><br />The son they create is exactly the kind of son you'd think would be
                                created by the union of and then raising by two monsters. The kind of rich kid who sets
                                a homeless woman on fire and thinks it's funny and is actually a favor to
                                society.<br /><br />I can't say this book is very fun to read.<br /><br /><i>"Mr.
                                    Lohman," he said. Then I punched him squarely in the nose. Right away there was
                                    blood, lots of blood: it sprayed from his nostrils and splattered across his shirt
                                    and the desktop, and then on the fingers with which he pawed at his
                                    nose.<br /><br />By that time I had come around the desk and hit him in the face
                                    again, lower down this time. His teeth hurt my knuckles as they broke off. He
                                    screamed.</i><br /><br />I know GONE GIRL shocked and titillated the world by
                                putting two horrible protagonists in the book, and that was fine. But now I feel like
                                this is not only old hat, but rather painful to read. There's no resolution. No one gets
                                their comeuppance or punishment. Good people are murdered and maimed and the soulless go
                                on with their existence, happy and rich and complete. THE END. Does this satisfy anyone?
                                It might be fun in a shocking way if it's the first book of this kind you've ever read,
                                but if you've read GONE GIRL then this is going to be more of the same for
                                you.<br /><br /><b>It's realistic.</b><br /><br />I'm laughing at how many people defend
                                this kind of novel by saying, "Well, it's realistic." or "That's just how life is." Evil
                                people do evil things and get away with them, feel no remorse and are never caught or
                                punished. Great, fine. It's realistic. That's not why I read fiction, emphasis on
                                'fiction.' I certainly don't need everything neat and tidy, but if you expect me to be
                                happy with this kind of novel, you are wrong.<br /><br />What I feel when I shut this
                                book is despair, disappointment, and apathy. That's NOT the way I want a book to make me
                                feel. I am very disinterested in this burgeoning subgenre called "sick fucks kill and
                                hurt people, then live happy and long lives being sick fucks and raising other sick
                                fucks." That's not appealing to me on any level.<br /><br />Tl;dr - Did you love GG and
                                hope another book would be JUST LIKE THIS?!!?! Here's your fix. However, if you are
                                tired and annoyed of MCs with no shred of humanity, not even the tiniest shred - stay
                                far away from this, which seems like a tired re-hash of ideas already
                                hashed.<br /><br />P.S. Also, this book purports that being a soulless sick fuck is an
                                inherited genetic trait. And that you can sense this disease - be tested for it when you
                                are in utero, amniotic fluid test - and if your fetus has this disease you should abort
                                it. It's strongly hinted in the book that Koch's talking about Asperger's. What a bunch
                                of shit. All of this is shit. What is this, <a
                                    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/467032.The_Bad_Seed"
                                    title="The Bad Seed by William March" rel="nofollow">The Bad Seed</a>, where some
                                people are born soulless, and just "Oh, well." Nurture has nothing to do with it, I
                                mean, you're either born a sick fuck or someone with normal feelings. AND ANOTHER THING.
                                People with Asperger's are fine. What is this author implying? If you are on the autism
                                spectrum or not neurotypical that you are a murdering asshole who maims and kills people
                                when things don't go your way?<br /><br />I wish this whole "I have a disorder, we
                                should have aborted my now-15-year-old-son in the womb because people with this
                                neurological disorder are soulless and will probably become serial killers" was left
                                out. I mean, what the fuck, dude? If you just realized the dad (the main character) was
                                fucked up, and then got to toy around with the idea in your mind like, "Nature or
                                nurture? Is his son soulless because he inherited his dad's no-soul gene, or did growing
                                up with a dad who literally bashed people's faces into a bloody pulp when they got in
                                his way make his child think such behavior was acceptable?" this would be more palatable
                                to me. But no, Koch has to make Paul (the MC dad) go to a psychologist who informs him
                                that if they had had in-utero testing 30 or 40 years ago, Paul himself would've been
                                aborted. Because being a soulless killer is an "illness" that can be detected in the
                                womb and preemptively stopped.<br /><br />Fuck this shit. Koch comes off as an ableist
                                jerk here, demonizing autism and Asperger's and thinking he can get away with it because
                                he doesn't say "the A-word," as my friend calls it.<br /><br />This book is really
                                angering me on many levels. Isn't it difficult enough to navigate a neurotypical world
                                without having people write books about autistic killers who go around murdering people?
                                I'm very angry.<br /><br />P.P.S. People keep saying "This book is about the lengths
                                you'll go to protect your family" and to me that is not what this book was about, AT
                                ALL. I guess every reader does read a different book.<br /><br />RELATED BOOKS:<br /><a

                                subtle humor, not so subtle humor, and casual conversation. The whole book could have
                                stayed right there and I wouldn't have minded at all. <br /><br />But, ohhh what
                                happened.... We gotta talk about the children. And that's when the main course got
                                really, really dark and you got to know everyone a little too well, more details than
                                you ever wanted to know, stories of the past that shouldn't really be unearthed. Not
                                here, not at dinner. <br /><br />People will say, "Ugh, I didn't like any of the
                                characters. They were all so awful. Boo hoo hoo." I didn't like any of these people
                                either. I was never rooting for anyone. I don't think that's the point of the book.
                                Yeah, it seems absurd that these parents had to make what we may see as easy decisions,
                                right? But, man, we're not running for prime minister, and aren't we all selfish at our
                                core anyway? Doesn't this maybe point out that we're probably always going to look out
                                for ourselves, and isn't that worse? How different am I from these people?
                                Ahhhh!!<br /><br />I loved the twists and turns of the novel, diving into Paul's past
                                and his relationship with his brother. It didn't turn these people into anti-heroes or
                                make me feel for them, but it made them three dimensional even if they were still pretty
                                awful. The way this book took a sharp turn and didn't lay off the brakes from there was
                                fantastic. I didn't think there was a moment wasted, and I loved each section of the
                                meal. I would even argue that it ended a little too abruptly after the slow climb to get
                                there. I would have liked a few more pages, maybe an epilogue or something. I don't
                                know. <br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I knocked out most of it in a
                                day. I would definitely recommend it for something a little darker, but please, for the
                                love of God...<br /><br />Don't compare this to Gone Girl.</span> <a

                                Brothers Serge and Paul and their wives have met to discuss their children and some
                                trouble the boys, cousins Rick and Michel have gotten themselves into. It's not
                                immediately apparent whether this trouble is the usual stuff the poor judgment of teens
                                produces or if it's something more serious. The tension at the table is evident from the
                                get-go. The rivalry between Paul and Serge is palatable. Serge picked the restaurant,
                                over priced and showy where only someone with his celebrity status could hope to get a
                                table. He's running for and likely to become the next Prime Minister. In contrast, Paul
                                is an out of work former teacher carrying lots of baggage. Between apertif and dessert,
                                with the in-between courses going from civilized to acrid hostility, the no good deed is
                                revealed. What lengths will these parents go to in order to save their
                                child?<br /><br />When I last picked up my napkin, dabbed my lips and placed it on the
                                table, I wish there were a character I liked. None were appetizing and I was left
                                feeling a bit nauseous. Not quite content and yet, wanting no more, even though some
                                morsel was missing. Call for the check and let me out of here.<br /><br />Given time to
                                digest, I relished in the deliciousness of the plot and this serving of evil. There's
                                enough to chew on here for a good book discussion.<br /><br />3.5 stars with a look for

                                review :<br /><br /><br /><br />They say, do they not, that The Dinner is the European
                                Gone Girl. Mais non! I say. I threw GG at the wall after around page 100 with some
                                force, but I finished The Dinner with a distinct smacking of the chops and dabbing of
                                the napkin, so that’s a big difference. Both books are about extremely irritating
                                people, it must be admitted. But the plot swerves in GG are more than a little
                                ridiculous and there for the standard lo-cal thriller effect, whereas I thought the
                                disturbed and frankly nasty personalities on display here were just this side of
                                plausible and therefore gave me a frisson, which sounds like something you could eat but
                                isn’t.<br /><br />It’s hard to discuss the plot. You know it’s all about one single
                                dinner in a very posh restaurant so the whole book is one evening from around 8 to
                                around 1 am but with copious flashbacks. The ultra-sophistication of the restaurant
                                brought me out in a cold sweat all by itself, with the maître d’ hovering by each dish
                                and <i>explaining</i> what is on the plate – “The goat’s cheese comes from the
                                Rarata-Monteoru region of Romania. It is an organic farm established by monks in 1459.
                                Each goat has a nominated chef to attend its dietary needs etc etc”. So all that is
                                quite amusing. <br /><br />It is two brothers and their wives who are eating this
                                dinner. Or actually pecking at it then jumping up and rushing outside to make a
                                mysterious phone call. Gradually the ghastly family secrets are unveiled. Each brother
                                has a 15 year old son and the two of them have been spoiler-oiler which is enough to put
                                a person off his escargots. It turns out that the brother who is narrating is
                                spoiler-spoil so you just don’t know what a guy like that will do. So very spoilerish
                                things have happened and indeed will happen. And I cannot say any more than that.
                                <br /><br />I rattled through this and as I did the movie was already forming in my
                                brain. I see fluid camerawork swirling round and round the table and many revolting
                                close-ups of the fancy grub. IMDB says it will be out next year starring Richard Gere,
                                Laura Linney and Steve Coogan. What? Steve Coogan? Is there time to change that?
                                <br /><br />Three stars. Kind of sort of slightly recommended. Haute cuisine is what
                                they eat in this novel but <i>The Dinner</i> is strictly burger and fries.</span> <a

                                to give it a read.<br /><br />Halfway through the novel I decided to consider this as
                                the epitome of contemporary fiction, among all the novels that I've read so far. It's
                                weird how endless ramblings regarding random things in life kept my attention for more
                                than 100+ pages. Palahniuk tried that style with me, but failed miserably. Koch on the
                                other hand managed to make me like the novel even more because of the rambling. I cared
                                about what he was trying to point out, and everything the main character said only made
                                me like him better.<br /><br />This novel, like I said, was messed up. If you're not a
                                fan of dark fiction, then I'd suggest you avoid this. It's not gut-wrenching in the same
                                way as some gore-y horror movies, but the outcome would make you question the sanity of
                                the characters, or even the author himself. I'm a fan of out of norm fiction, so that
                                means I don't mind if the author tackles on topics that are profane and socially
                                unacceptable. I'm not one to promote such activities, of course, because I'm against
                                them, but writing about those doesn't mean that the author automatically thinks that
                                it's supposed to be right. <br /><br />The plot took a while for it to develop. Halfway
                                through I honestly still didn't know what was the main focus of the novel. The secret
                                wasn't revealed then and I was impatiently waiting for it to be discussed further. At
                                first I thought that the novel was going to have a terrible plot because of its
                                seemingly nonexistent development, but thankfully I was proven wrong.<br /><br />The
                                characters were the main reason why this novel was messed up. Let me add in the fact
                                though that messed up doesn't mean it was bad. I mean messed up in a positive way.
                                Psychologically challenged characters are the best to read about, at least for me. Paul,
                                Claire, Serge, and Babette were all amazing, and fully developed in the end. One or two
                                of the four truly shocked me in the end of the novel. I didn't expect them to develop
                                the way they did but the author knew what he was doing.<br /><br />In the end one may
                                ask, "What was this truly about?". In my opinion, it was about how one would do anything
                                to keep their family safe, no matter what the consequences may be. The love of a couple
                                for their child, and how nothing can stand against that.<br /><br />4.5/5 stars. Why
                                round it down? It's because I needed more. The novel felt like it was cut short too
                                early. The ending was not ambiguous, and I liked what happened in the end. It does feel
                                like a European Gone Girl, so get ready for messed up to the tenth power. Highly
                                recommended for psychological thriller fans, because this felt like a mixture of
                                contemporary and psycho-thriller. </span> <a data-text-id="8833225863333963728" href="#"

                                favorite books in the domestic noir genre. It is not a book for everyone. It is biting,
                                raw and the darkest humor you can imagine. Almost the entire story is set at a
                                restaurant table.<br /><br />There are two unhappy couples having dinner together and
                                acting as if everything is fine. As we go from appetizers to dessert, the reader gets a
                                sense that something is very wrong here. A simmering beneath the surface kind of
                                tension. It continues to build until all the secrets are exposed. I could not put this
                                book down except for minutes at a time and then I was constantly wondering "what in the
                                world is going on here?"<br /><br />Each couple has a son. These sons are cousins to
                                each other, because their dads are brothers.  The sons have done something horrible.
                                Really bad. And the parents are here not just to eat dinner at a fancy restaurant, but
                                to work out how this situation their sons are in should be handled. All four members at
                                the table have a different agenda, a different perspective, a different personality
                                flaw.<br /><br />The narrator, Paul, is sarcastic and funny and relatable. He could be
                                someone you know. But when you find out the true Paul, who he is when no one is
                                watching, you realize you probably don't know anyone like him and you certainly don't
                                want to.<br /><br />To me, this book is a rare find. It is very well written, even
                                though it is translated from Dutch to English. Amazing, the English major in me
                                rejoices! A brilliant and literary, domestic suspense story.</span> <a

                                review one as we speak.<br /><br /><i>The Dinner</i>'s main character is an angry,
                                reflective guy out at a restaurant with his wife, brother, and sister-in-law. The action
                                unfolds over the evening and through flashbacks. I suppose one of comparisons between
                                <i>The Dinner</i> and the Gillian Flynn-novel-that-will-not-be-named emerges from the
                                fact I couldn't write a review of either without fearing revealing spoilers. Koch's
                                novel is tighter, however, in its focus on familiar relationships, whether they be
                                father/son, mother/son, father/mother, or brother/brother. The narrators gets to
                                articulate the terrific hatred and frustration inherent in minor interactions and
                                (perhaps) over-sensitivity to slights and manipulation when one's mind isn't quite in
                                the right place. And the deep darkness connects to the question of whether or not
                                families can retain a semblance of normalcy or even grow closer when the stakeholders
                                lie, scheme, and withhold, sometimes to each other, sometimes for each
                                other.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed <i>The Dinner</i>. I don't re-read much but I
                                could see myself re-reading the novel in a month or two because the elegant structure
                                deserves a second look. This book is better than its the "European <i>Gone Girl</i> or
                                "topic of countless dinner party debates" horseshit tag lines. Read <i>The Dinner</i> on
                                its own terms.</span> <a data-text-id="8836807929760879918" href="#"

                                think I'll ever get their waiters pointy little finger out of my head, as he uses it to
                                point to each item of food as it arrives. You know, those fancy restaurants who call
                                three slices of cheese on a plate the most extraordinary cuisine, with each described
                                meticulously. <br /><br />Sorry, the story...The first 20% or so focuses on Paul's
                                memories and how he, and each of the characters have interacted in the past. It seems to
                                plod along a bit, however, later, the fleshing out of these characters proves
                                vital.<br /><br />Here's what happened after the first 20%, BAM!! WHAT? WHAT JUST
                                HAPPENED? The "problem" related to their children, begins to be reveled, and I was in
                                complete shock. From this point on, I was riveted to my chair, reading at record speed,
                                with a lot of OMG's! What the children were involved in, and the parent's ideals and
                                backgrounds really come into play now with how the situation will be handled.
                                <br /><br />What I liked so much is the extremely uncomfortable questions the author
                                wants us to ponder, such as: Do our moral responsibilities lie with the protection of
                                our family, or with the larger picture of societies morals? Can violence be hereditary?
                                Do we all have a private and a public face? Are "real" families only those with similar
                                genes? Is a happy family one that sticks together at all costs? Are certain people
                                valued more because of their social standing or intelligence? Do we have a secret
                                vigilante wish to kill those who cannot be rehabilitated, and where do we draw that
                                line?<br /><br />I love that this book took me down the dark side. I didn't like a
                                single character, but sure did love the book. So, if you'd like your Gone Girl a little
                                darker, you won't be disappointed!</span> <a data-text-id="9707278729076965293" href="#"

                                Dutch prime minister, and his wife Babette. The plan is to discuss over dinner how to
                                handle a crime committed by their teenage sons, Michel and Rick, respectively. The
                                violent act of the two boys had been filmed by a security camera and shown on TV, but,
                                so far, they have not been identified. The parents have to decide on what to do. They
                                debate over dinner causing tension throughout the evening. ...<br /><br />تاریخ نخستین

                                انعام<br /><br />داستان از آن جایی آغاز میشود، که در یک عصر تابستان دو برادر، به همراه
                                همسران خویش، بر سر میز شامی بنشسته‌ اند، و در تلاشند یکی از مهم‌ترین تصمیمات زندگی خود
                                را بگیرند، این چهار تن درباره‌ ی واقعیتی، که ذهن آن‌ها را به خود درگیر کرده، گفتگو
                                می‌کنند. نقل نمونه متن: «یکشنبه بعد از ظهر، پنج روز بعد از شروع اثر داروها، روی مبل سالن
                                خانه دراز کشیده بودم، و روزنامه می‌خواندم. از در شیشه‌ ای که به حیاط باز می‌شد،
                                می‌توانستم ببینم که باران شروع به باریدن کرده‌ است. آسمان آن روز آبی با ابرهای سفید لکه‌
                                ای بود. باید بگویم که این اواخر از اینکه در خانه‌ ی خودم، در سالن، روی مبل نشسته باشم
                                ترس برم می‌داشت. ترسم ناشی از حسی بود، که نسبت به افراد دیگر در شرایط مشابه به خودم
                                داشتم. اینکه صدها نفر دیگر مثل من در خانه‌ شان روی مبل دراز کشیده‌ اند. بیشتر وقت‌ها در
                                تاریکی به این فکر می‌کردم، که حالا که همه‌ ی آدم‌ها در خانه‌ شان هستند، چه اتفاقی
                                می‌افتد. از جایی که روی مبل دراز کشیده بودم، نمی‌توانستم کسی ‌را ببینم، چون بوته‌ های
                                سبزی جلوی پنجره بودند؛ ولی همین حسی که پشت این بوته‌ ها، خانه‌ های دیگری بودند، و پشت
                                پنجره‌ های دیگر هم آدم‌هایی مثل من دراز کشیده‌ اند، و یا نشسته‌ اند، حس خفقان خاصی را به
                                من منتقل می‌کرد. باید بگویم از مردم و یا بهتر بگویم آدم‌ها ترس نداشتم. از داشتن شرایط
                                مشابه هراس داشتم. از تکرار وضعیت همانندمان می‌ترسیدم. به هر صورت قبل از استفاده از این
                                داروها آدمی نبودم که بخواهم در جشن‌ها، و یا دورهمی‌های دوستانه، خودنمایی بکنم، و یا مجلس
                                را با خوش صحبتیم بچرخانم. بیشتر شبیه کسی بودم که دلش می‌خواهد گوشه‌ گیری بکند، جایی
                                بنشیند و با کسی حرف نزند. باید بگویم اینجوری متفاوت بودم.»؛ پایان نقل. ا. شربیانی</span>

                                through the eyes of Paul, but that doesn't mean you like him. <br />I can't see this
                                book being made into a movie. So much of the “dialog” is Paul talking directly to the
                                reader, giving you his opinion on events. And as the book goes on, you start questioning
                                the man's sanity. <br /><br />I am reading this for book club and am anxious for the
                                discussion. This is definitely one of those books where you don't care for the
                                characters but there's lots of meat to discuss. It's not an easy read, definitely not a
                                feel good. But it does grip you and force you to think how you would act in a similar
                                situation. Hopefully not like these four parents…<br /><br /></span> <a

                                of the subject matter.<br /><br />Two middle-aged couples dine out at an expensive
                                Amsterdam restaurant. As they go through each extravagant, rather absurd course
                                (presided over by a memorable restaurant worker who points at things with his pinky!),
                                we flash back to scenes involving their children. The quartet are dining out to discuss
                                an incident that may affect everyone’s future.<br /><br />Despite the contrived setting
                                – I doubt they would meet in such a public way to talk about such a sensitive, private
                                matter – the book is cleverly constructed. And narrator Paul, a former history teacher
                                who resents his boorish older brother Serge’s political success, plays with our
                                sympathies. <br /><br />At first we’re on Paul’s side; he’s amusing, self-deprecating
                                and his cutting social observations (about the restaurant, about his brother) seem as
                                sharp as a chef's knife. But as the night goes on and he fills us in on his past – and
                                that of his wife, Claire, and his son, Michel – things become more sinister. Then they
                                become downright creepy. <br /><br />The disturbing act at the centre of the book brings
                                up lots of ethical and moral questions, and Koch handles the teasing out of this
                                incident brilliantly. He’s less successful near the end, where he practically rushes
                                through to the denouement. <br /><br />But the jagged little pieces of this narrative
                                fit together into one horrific portrait of family life. I’m definitely going to read
                                Koch’s <a

                                tackle this book.<br /><br />But something funny happened on the way to this review... I
                                didn't hate the book. Instead, I got engrossed in the novel and wanted to see how it
                                ended. The story is that two couples are meeting at an expensive restaurant for dinner.
                                One of the couples is our narrator and his wife, Claire; the other is Serge, a
                                politician (and the brother of our narrator), and Serge's wife, Babette. Both couples
                                have teenage sons, and the dinner meeting is to discuss something horrible the children
                                did. Our narrator doesn't like his brother and often tries to antagonize him, which adds
                                more tension to the conversation.<br /><br />The novel is organized by the courses of a
                                dinner: Apertif, Appetizer, Main Course, etc. The events take place over the course of
                                one evening, with a few flashbacks to important events. I wasn't surprised to learn that
                                the author has a background in acting, because while reading this novel I could envision
                                it as a dramatic play. (Or a movie, which is apparently being released soon. It was dumb
                                luck that I read this book so close to the film's debut.) <br /><br />All we know is
                                what our narrator tells us, and at times he and his memories are unreliable. Many
                                reviewers have commented on how unlikable all of the characters are, which is true --
                                they are selfish, vain, and inconsiderate, and our narrator's family is especially
                                violent and has anger management issues -- but really, our society seems fascinated by
                                such sociopaths. They are the subject of countless movies and bestselling books, and we
                                love to hate them (or elect them president, but that's another story).<br /><br />In
                                this book, we're inside a sociopath's head. Our narrator is sharing how he views the
                                world, and it is fascinating. Of course we don't condone his actions, but he seems
                                rather calm and rational, up until the moment he starts beating you.<br /><br />While I
                                ended up getting involved in the story, this was a difficult novel to read because of
                                the violence and brutal descriptions. I frequently winced while reading, or had to pause
                                to take a breath. Our narrator makes some amusing comments, but even his humor becomes
                                snarky and bitter.<br /><br />As disturbing as it was, I did appreciate this novel and
                                its theme of exploring how far parents will go to protect a child, but I'm not sure I
                                would widely recommend this book. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, and you'll
                                be disappointed if you expect any of the characters to grow and become better people.
                                This is a dark family story -- it's all villains and no heroes.<br /><br /><b>Amusing
                                    Passage:</b><br />
                                <blockquote> <br />When the conversation turns too quickly to films, I see it as a sign
                                    of weakness. I mean: films are more something for the end of the evening, when you
                                    really don't have much else to talk about. I don't know why, but when people start
                                    talking about films, I always get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, like
                                    when you wake up in the morning and find that it's already getting dark
                                    outside.<br /><br />The worst are those people who describe entire films. They get
                                    right into it -- they have no qualms about taking up fifteen minutes of your time;
                                    fifteen minutes per film, that is. They don't really care whether you haven't seen
                                    the film in question or whether you saw it a long time ago. Such considerations
                                    don't bother them -- they're already right in the middle of the opening scene. To be
                                    polite, you feign interest at first, but soon you bid farewell to courtesy: You yawn
                                    openly, stare at the ceiling, and squirm around in your chair. You do everything in
                                    your power to make the narrator shut up, but nothing helps. They're too far gone to
                                    notice the signals. Above all, they're addicted to themselves and their own crap
                                    about films.<br /></blockquote>

                                these two couples, related by blood, would go to a high end restaurant where one member
                                of the foursome is a well-known up and coming politician to discuss a private,
                                disturbing, life-altering matter regarding their children. Wouldn't they simply meet at
                                one of their houses to discuss this? Some of the events that unfold and personality
                                traits that are revealed are somewhat over the top. One of the four would already either
                                be institutionalized or behind bars for prior actions described. The buildup is not as
                                expected or should be. I felt cheated by this book and the fact that all the characters
                                lack such a moral compass. The ones who show a flash of morality near the end have it
                                quickly snuffed out by the other characters. It is a decidedly unsatisfying, and not
