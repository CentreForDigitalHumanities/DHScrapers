To begin with, the character who narrates the book comes across as petty, childish, and irritating from the opening pages. He was never a sympathetic character, although I believe he initially was supposed to be, in comparison to his brother. The brother, a boorish, pompous and larger than life figure, actually had more heart in the long run. In addition, I didn't find it believable that these two couples, related by blood, would go to a high end restaurant where one member of the foursome is a well-known up and coming politician to discuss a private, disturbing, life-altering matter regarding their children. Wouldn't they simply meet at one of their houses to discuss this? Some of the events that unfold and personality traits that are revealed are somewhat over the top. One of the four would already either be institutionalized or behind bars for prior actions described. The buildup is not as expected or should be. I felt cheated by this book and the fact that all the characters lack such a moral compass. The ones who show a flash of morality near the end have it quickly snuffed out by the other characters. It is a decidedly unsatisfying, and not very believable, read.</text></scrape>
