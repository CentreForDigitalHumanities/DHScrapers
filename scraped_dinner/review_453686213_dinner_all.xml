It felt contrived and stilted. I didn't like any of the characters. I couldn't identify with any of them. None of the dialogue was believable. The situation was farcical (why would you go to a super-expensive, elite restaurant to talk about such a private matter?). The whole book was about protecting the kids from their own actions - their was no sense of personal responsibility, no remorse, no soul searching. The narrator was a violent thug who just whined incessantly the whole way through the book. He was as big a bore as his brother.I can't begin to describe how irritated and ripped off I felt by this book.To compare it to The Slap (by Australian author Christos Tsiolkas) is such a joke. The characters in that book were so well written and, while not always likeable (in fact some were really icky), they were believable. And it explored the underlying issues and fallout from the "event" that the book gets its name from.I felt like the The Dinner was a cheap stunt designed to make the reader feel like they had explored something deep, dark and dangerous. It is white-bread, middle class, lite-lit of the worst kind.</text></scrape>
