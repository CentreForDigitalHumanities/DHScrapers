This is a novel that has been sitting on my shelf for several years, and I finally pulled it down in a good-faith effort to read more of the books I already own. I don't remember why I was so interested in this that I bought a copy, so I skimmed some reviews to jog my memory. I saw everything from 1 star to 5 stars from Goodreads friends, with some very heated comments about the characters and the story. It lowered my expectations, and I felt ready to tackle this book.But something funny happened on the way to this review... I didn't hate the book. Instead, I got engrossed in the novel and wanted to see how it ended. The story is that two couples are meeting at an expensive restaurant for dinner. One of the couples is our narrator and his wife, Claire; the other is Serge, a politician (and the brother of our narrator), and Serge's wife, Babette. Both couples have teenage sons, and the dinner meeting is to discuss something horrible the children did. Our narrator doesn't like his brother and often tries to antagonize him, which adds more tension to the conversation.The novel is organized by the courses of a dinner: Apertif, Appetizer, Main Course, etc. The events take place over the course of one evening, with a few flashbacks to important events. I wasn't surprised to learn that the author has a background in acting, because while reading this novel I could envision it as a dramatic play. (Or a movie, which is apparently being released soon. It was dumb luck that I read this book so close to the film's debut.) All we know is what our narrator tells us, and at times he and his memories are unreliable. Many reviewers have commented on how unlikable all of the characters are, which is true -- they are selfish, vain, and inconsiderate, and our narrator's family is especially violent and has anger management issues -- but really, our society seems fascinated by such sociopaths. They are the subject of countless movies and bestselling books, and we love to hate them (or elect them president, but that's another story).In this book, we're inside a sociopath's head. Our narrator is sharing how he views the world, and it is fascinating. Of course we don't condone his actions, but he seems rather calm and rational, up until the moment he starts beating you.While I ended up getting involved in the story, this was a difficult novel to read because of the violence and brutal descriptions. I frequently winced while reading, or had to pause to take a breath. Our narrator makes some amusing comments, but even his humor becomes snarky and bitter.As disturbing as it was, I did appreciate this novel and its theme of exploring how far parents will go to protect a child, but I'm not sure I would widely recommend this book. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, and you'll be disappointed if you expect any of the characters to grow and become better people. This is a dark family story -- it's all villains and no heroes.Amusing Passage:  When the conversation turns too quickly to films, I see it as a sign of weakness. I mean: films are more something for the end of the evening, when you really don't have much else to talk about. I don't know why, but when people start talking about films, I always get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, like when you wake up in the morning and find that it's already getting dark outside.The worst are those people who describe entire films. They get right into it -- they have no qualms about taking up fifteen minutes of your time; fifteen minutes per film, that is. They don't really care whether you haven't seen the film in question or whether you saw it a long time ago. Such considerations don't bother them -- they're already right in the middle of the opening scene. To be polite, you feign interest at first, but soon you bid farewell to courtesy: You yawn openly, stare at the ceiling, and squirm around in your chair. You do everything in your power to make the narrator shut up, but nothing helps. They're too far gone to notice the signals. Above all, they're addicted to themselves and their own crap about films.</text></scrape>
