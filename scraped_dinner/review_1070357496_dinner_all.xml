And, after reading some reviews, maybe it did, and I just never saw it. For me, this book is a top notch psychological thriller.Two couples meet at a posh restaurant for dinner, arriving to discuss some type of problem with their children. The two couples are Paul, and his wife Clair, and Serge (Paul's brother), and his wife Babette. Paul is the single narrator of this story and he recounts much of his past as each course of dinner arrives. I don't think I'll ever get their waiters pointy little finger out of my head, as he uses it to point to each item of food as it arrives. You know, those fancy restaurants who call three slices of cheese on a plate the most extraordinary cuisine, with each described meticulously. Sorry, the story...The first 20% or so focuses on Paul's memories and how he, and each of the characters have interacted in the past. It seems to plod along a bit, however, later, the fleshing out of these characters proves vital.Here's what happened after the first 20%, BAM!! WHAT? WHAT JUST HAPPENED? The "problem" related to their children, begins to be reveled, and I was in complete shock. From this point on, I was riveted to my chair, reading at record speed, with a lot of OMG's! What the children were involved in, and the parent's ideals and backgrounds really come into play now with how the situation will be handled. What I liked so much is the extremely uncomfortable questions the author wants us to ponder, such as: Do our moral responsibilities lie with the protection of our family, or with the larger picture of societies morals? Can violence be hereditary? Do we all have a private and a public face? Are "real" families only those with similar genes? Is a happy family one that sticks together at all costs? Are certain people valued more because of their social standing or intelligence? Do we have a secret vigilante wish to kill those who cannot be rehabilitated, and where do we draw that line?I love that this book took me down the dark side. I didn't like a single character, but sure did love the book. So, if you'd like your Gone Girl a little darker, you won't be disappointed!</text></scrape>
