When Hogarth Publishers agreed to send me the e-galley of The Dinner I was ecstatic. It's due to be published in the states in February 2013. This is a book that begs eating metaphors so I'll try to spare you but it won't be easy. The Dinner is laid out in courses, from aperitif to digestif and is excellently plotted. You learn early on that this dinner is not the typical happy family outing. Brothers Serge and Paul and their wives have met to discuss their children and some trouble the boys, cousins Rick and Michel have gotten themselves into. It's not immediately apparent whether this trouble is the usual stuff the poor judgment of teens produces or if it's something more serious. The tension at the table is evident from the get-go. The rivalry between Paul and Serge is palatable. Serge picked the restaurant, over priced and showy where only someone with his celebrity status could hope to get a table. He's running for and likely to become the next Prime Minister. In contrast, Paul is an out of work former teacher carrying lots of baggage. Between apertif and dessert, with the in-between courses going from civilized to acrid hostility, the no good deed is revealed. What lengths will these parents go to in order to save their child?When I last picked up my napkin, dabbed my lips and placed it on the table, I wish there were a character I liked. None were appetizing and I was left feeling a bit nauseous. Not quite content and yet, wanting no more, even though some morsel was missing. Call for the check and let me out of here.Given time to digest, I relished in the deliciousness of the plot and this serving of evil. There's enough to chew on here for a good book discussion.3.5 stars with a look for more from this author.</text></scrape>
