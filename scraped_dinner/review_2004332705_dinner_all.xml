The pretentiousness was mind boggling. These are people for whom it's important who arrives last for a dinner reservation, for whom appearance is all. They meet at a restaurant that reminds me of The Emperor's New Clothes. Will no one admit to the laughingly almost empty plates of unique ingredients? And it goes downhill from there. These aren't people you're going to like. Those opening chapters give you an inkling of how these folks will deal with the horrendous thing their boys have done. We see everything through the eyes of Paul, but that doesn't mean you like him. I can't see this book being made into a movie. So much of the “dialog” is Paul talking directly to the reader, giving you his opinion on events. And as the book goes on, you start questioning the man's sanity. I am reading this for book club and am anxious for the discussion. This is definitely one of those books where you don't care for the characters but there's lots of meat to discuss. It's not an easy read, definitely not a feel good. But it does grip you and force you to think how you would act in a similar situation. Hopefully not like these four parents…</text></scrape>
