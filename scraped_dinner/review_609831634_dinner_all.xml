But seriously, motherfuckers, this novel is more like Flynn's Sharp Objects and, in my eyes, better than Gone Girl. So let's stop talking about Gone Girl, even though I liked that book, because, you know, there are other books in the goddamn universe and I'm trying to review one as we speak.The Dinner's main character is an angry, reflective guy out at a restaurant with his wife, brother, and sister-in-law. The action unfolds over the evening and through flashbacks. I suppose one of comparisons between The Dinner and the Gillian Flynn-novel-that-will-not-be-named emerges from the fact I couldn't write a review of either without fearing revealing spoilers. Koch's novel is tighter, however, in its focus on familiar relationships, whether they be father/son, mother/son, father/mother, or brother/brother. The narrators gets to articulate the terrific hatred and frustration inherent in minor interactions and (perhaps) over-sensitivity to slights and manipulation when one's mind isn't quite in the right place. And the deep darkness connects to the question of whether or not families can retain a semblance of normalcy or even grow closer when the stakeholders lie, scheme, and withhold, sometimes to each other, sometimes for each other.I very much enjoyed The Dinner. I don't re-read much but I could see myself re-reading the novel in a month or two because the elegant structure deserves a second look. This book is better than its the "European Gone Girl or "topic of countless dinner party debates" horseshit tag lines. Read The Dinner on its own terms.</text></scrape>
