What would this artificial voice sound like if its owner were to be dragged into a barn by a pair of French bricklayers? So drunk they could no longer tell the difference between a woman and the ruins of a cottage with only the walls still standing? Would she still be shooting off her mouth...The sequel to GONE GIRL. Two white, rich, soulless, violent sociopaths have a child and that child is growing up to become a soulless, violent sociopath as well.You get the idea that something is wrong with our narrator, Paul, early on. He loves the movies DELIVERANCE and STRAW DOGS and he often fantasizes about punching people and killing them.It's only later that you realize that he has put multiple people in the hospital.And it's not until very close to the end of the novel that you realize his wife is just as bad as he is. Until then you have a hope or a sympathy that perhaps she is a good person.The son they create is exactly the kind of son you'd think would be created by the union of and then raising by two monsters. The kind of rich kid who sets a homeless woman on fire and thinks it's funny and is actually a favor to society.I can't say this book is very fun to read."Mr. Lohman," he said. Then I punched him squarely in the nose. Right away there was blood, lots of blood: it sprayed from his nostrils and splattered across his shirt and the desktop, and then on the fingers with which he pawed at his nose.By that time I had come around the desk and hit him in the face again, lower down this time. His teeth hurt my knuckles as they broke off. He screamed.I know GONE GIRL shocked and titillated the world by putting two horrible protagonists in the book, and that was fine. But now I feel like this is not only old hat, but rather painful to read. There's no resolution. No one gets their comeuppance or punishment. Good people are murdered and maimed and the soulless go on with their existence, happy and rich and complete. THE END. Does this satisfy anyone? It might be fun in a shocking way if it's the first book of this kind you've ever read, but if you've read GONE GIRL then this is going to be more of the same for you.It's realistic.I'm laughing at how many people defend this kind of novel by saying, "Well, it's realistic." or "That's just how life is." Evil people do evil things and get away with them, feel no remorse and are never caught or punished. Great, fine. It's realistic. That's not why I read fiction, emphasis on 'fiction.' I certainly don't need everything neat and tidy, but if you expect me to be happy with this kind of novel, you are wrong.What I feel when I shut this book is despair, disappointment, and apathy. That's NOT the way I want a book to make me feel. I am very disinterested in this burgeoning subgenre called "sick fucks kill and hurt people, then live happy and long lives being sick fucks and raising other sick fucks." That's not appealing to me on any level.Tl;dr - Did you love GG and hope another book would be JUST LIKE THIS?!!?! Here's your fix. However, if you are tired and annoyed of MCs with no shred of humanity, not even the tiniest shred - stay far away from this, which seems like a tired re-hash of ideas already hashed.P.S. Also, this book purports that being a soulless sick fuck is an inherited genetic trait. And that you can sense this disease - be tested for it when you are in utero, amniotic fluid test - and if your fetus has this disease you should abort it. It's strongly hinted in the book that Koch's talking about Asperger's. What a bunch of shit. All of this is shit. What is this, The Bad Seed, where some people are born soulless, and just "Oh, well." Nurture has nothing to do with it, I mean, you're either born a sick fuck or someone with normal feelings. AND ANOTHER THING. People with Asperger's are fine. What is this author implying? If you are on the autism spectrum or not neurotypical that you are a murdering asshole who maims and kills people when things don't go your way?I wish this whole "I have a disorder, we should have aborted my now-15-year-old-son in the womb because people with this neurological disorder are soulless and will probably become serial killers" was left out. I mean, what the fuck, dude? If you just realized the dad (the main character) was fucked up, and then got to toy around with the idea in your mind like, "Nature or nurture? Is his son soulless because he inherited his dad's no-soul gene, or did growing up with a dad who literally bashed people's faces into a bloody pulp when they got in his way make his child think such behavior was acceptable?" this would be more palatable to me. But no, Koch has to make Paul (the MC dad) go to a psychologist who informs him that if they had had in-utero testing 30 or 40 years ago, Paul himself would've been aborted. Because being a soulless killer is an "illness" that can be detected in the womb and preemptively stopped.Fuck this shit. Koch comes off as an ableist jerk here, demonizing autism and Asperger's and thinking he can get away with it because he doesn't say "the A-word," as my friend calls it.This book is really angering me on many levels. Isn't it difficult enough to navigate a neurotypical world without having people write books about autistic killers who go around murdering people? I'm very angry.P.P.S. People keep saying "This book is about the lengths you'll go to protect your family" and to me that is not what this book was about, AT ALL. I guess every reader does read a different book.RELATED BOOKS:Gone GirlA Bum Deal: An Unlikely Journey from Hopeless to Humanitarian</text></scrape>
