The language and style - so nice. However, the story did nothing for me. All of this great character development about characters that have no redeeming qualities. It didn't solicit anything in me - no compassion, empathy, or concern. I don't know. Maybe that was the point - to lay out a story that should solicit something but do it in a way the does not.</text></scrape>
