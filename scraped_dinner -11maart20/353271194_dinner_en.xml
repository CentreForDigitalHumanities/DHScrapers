It really is disturbing and unnerving, yet also compulsively readable. The narrator is like listening to myself at my most obsessively cynical and misanthropic; I often have to stop reading while I think 'oh no, am I really that bad?'. The issue at the heart of the story - the length you go to protect the ones you love - is perfectly presented and I can't wait to see how the story pans out. Loving this so far.And I loved it overall. Very strong characters, gradually revealed over the course of the book (and the courses of the dinner). A tasty dish indeed.</text></scrape>
