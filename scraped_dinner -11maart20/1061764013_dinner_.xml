They are two brothers and their wives who meet because they want to discuss something their sons have done. It's the kind of story that's like a swimming swan - there's much more going on under the surface than is visible above it. One of the brothers is running for Prime Minister in a forthcoming election and is concerned with his prospects and how things look to outsiders. His brother is an ex-history teacher who left his job with health issues. So much here is implied rather than stated but it leaves no doubt that he has a possibly heritable condition leaving the sufferer with a propensity to violence. The sons have been seen on CCTV footage committing an atrocity but only their families are able to recognise them from the poor quality film.I see that reviewers are divided about this book. The characters are not at all sympathetic and many readers want to like or side with a character. If you can get past this, the story gives much food for thought. Would you protect your child more than you would desire to uphold justice? How much of our opinions, views and behaviour are inherited and how much learned? I read this in a couple of days. It grabbed tightly me and wouldn't let go. </text></scrape>
