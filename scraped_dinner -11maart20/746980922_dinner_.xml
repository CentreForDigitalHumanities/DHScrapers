The first one hundred pages are on the nuances of eating at a fancy restaurant. I'm sorry but this bored the heck out of me. Then the book actually gets to the point and then the author finally gets into the "event" that has happened to the two kids. All of the characters but one have no moral compass. Throughout the book, the author starts talking about something and then will say that he will not go into further detail on what is happening. This makes the book frustrating and confusing. </text></scrape>
