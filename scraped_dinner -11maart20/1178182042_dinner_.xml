I started listening to it and was bored out of my mind, at about 25% I thought about giving up, but I wanted to know what the boys did, so I kept going. Now that I'm done I sort of wished that I had given it up. This family is so screwed up! I can't believe what they hid, what they did, and more importantly what they didn't do. With how Paul kept talking about Serge I was predisposed to not like him, after all is said and done he is the most ethical one and I wished that he wouldn't have been stopped. I hardly know what to think of Claire and Paul, both are off their rockers, feel sorry for Michele because with parents like his actions don't seem that off. I'm at the point now where I want them all to be caught and punished, they deserve it!</text></scrape>
