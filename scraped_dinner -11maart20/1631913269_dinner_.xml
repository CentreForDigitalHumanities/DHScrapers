I was intrigued by the story and the characters and as the story progresses my feelings for each character changed. The fact that I had such strong emotions toward these characters definitely speaks about the authors ability to write great un likable people. Towards the end I was shocked at how this story unfolded and how disturbing it was to read. I really enjoyed this one.</text></scrape>
