It made me think of Tolstoy's "All happy families are alike...." quote; there can't be another happy family quite like this one in all of literature. At first, you think that you're reading a completely different kind of book. The narrator, Paul, and his loving and sensible wife, Claire are on the way to have dinner with Serge and Babette. These two couples need to have a conversation about an incident involving their children. We are given to believe that Serge, Paul's brother, is an insufferable human being. Serge is also famous, and may soon become the country's new Prime Minister. At the snooty restaurant that Serge has chosen, Paul's observations about everything - from Serge and Babette's grand entrance, to the servers' attire, to the fussy descriptions of the food - are at first quite amusing. As the dinner progresses, you gradually realize that your first impression of all of these people was wrong. Really, dangerously wrong. I enjoyed the trick.</text></scrape>
