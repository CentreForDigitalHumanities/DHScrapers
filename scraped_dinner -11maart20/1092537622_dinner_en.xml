You are not going to like these people, but you will be fascinated by them, the same way we can't turn away from a horrible car wreck with mangled bodies strewn all over the road. You know it's going to be gruesome, but you can't look away. The setting is a very posh, exclusive restaurant, the kind with gloved waiters and 3 month waiting lists. The story unfolds during each of the dinner's five courses. Two couples, middle-aged brothers and their wives, dine together to discuss a harrowing secret involving their teenage sons. Each new dish is served with menacing new secrets about each character and insight into their twisted relationships with each other. As the meal progresses, your perception of each character evolves dramatically. This story starts out with slow momentum but please stick with it, it builds with tremendous force right up until the shocking end. Don't miss this one, it will make the hair on the back of your neck stand straight up! </text></scrape>
