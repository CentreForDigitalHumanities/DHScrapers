The reviews are very mixed, some hate it so much, some loved it a lot and some just didn't get it. The topic of this book is how far would you go to protect the one you love. It is a dark story. How could you live as if nothing had ever happened after knowing the terrible truth? No characters are likable. But I could not put this book down. I just loved the author's style. I enjoyed this book more than "Gone Girl".</text></scrape>
