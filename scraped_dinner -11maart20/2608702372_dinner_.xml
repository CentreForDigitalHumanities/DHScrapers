Almost the entire first half of the book is about a dinner (food) the entire second half of the book IS NOT. The first half is very superficial but the second half of the book goes into the characters background and personalities and it’s super easy to follow because there’s only like 7 characters, 4 main ones at most. I don’t want to give away the book but if I had to sum it up in one word I would say it was CRUEL. I mean you can also describe is as:understanding, cooperative, and strategic; however, at end the emotion that I was left with was DISGUST and CRUELTY (not emotion but you get it). I would recommend this book to all and I feel that it is very well written. I notice people either absolutely hate or love this book, I feel that you can absolutely hate the story....but it’s presented and written very well and for that it should get 4 stars alone. Basic premise: two brothers with wives meet, and you begin to understand how their personalities clash together and with their offsprings.</text></scrape>
