They are the narrator Paul Lohman, his wife Claire, his elder brother Serge, and Serge's wife Babette. At first, the tone is cattily caustic, commenting on the way the empty space on the huge plates seems to have more significance than the artfully arranged portions of food in the middle of them, or the head waiter's habit of pointing out the provenance of every ingredient with his pinky finger. [I have eaten in an Amsterdam restaurant like that; maybe even in this one.]But the venom soon becomes more personal. Serge is a politician, supposedly a shoo-in for Prime Minister at the next election. Paul clearly has no taste for his brother's pretension, and considers him a boor whose veneer of sophistication is as opportunistic as his pose as an ordinary man of the people. Politicians make easy targets, and Serge comes straight from central casting. Clearly we are in for some fun.Then things begin to change, and Paul reveals himself as by no means the straightforward narrator that he had at first appeared. I won't give more details, except to say that the dinner begins to be about the family members who are not there, particularly the two teenage sons. By means of flashbacks going back years, months, or days, Koch opens yawning abysses of amorality. What is shocking is not just what actually happens, but the way the characters seem to accept it as normal, and then abet it with actions of their own. No one remains unsullied. The book may well be an indictment of contemporary Dutch society, but it raises disturbing questions also about moral values everywhere.Disturbing, yes, but unputdownable. I thought more than once of early Ian McEwan, such as 
  The Cement Garden
 or The Comfort of Strangers. Also of Patricia Highsmith's skill, from 
  Strangers on a Train
 onwards, at plunging outwardly normal people into criminality and violence. And not for nothing does Paul Lohman, our narrator, say that his two favorite movies are Straw Dogs and Deliverance. The only criticism I have is that Koch takes us away from the continuity of the dinner table for too long in the middle. But he is a master of indirection, and there will be surprises coming at you right up to the last page.</text></scrape>
