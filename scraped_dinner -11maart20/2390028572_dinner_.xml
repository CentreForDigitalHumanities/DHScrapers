But I can’t bring myself to give it any higher than this. While I enjoyed it and found it entertaining, it’s not the type of book that I would recommend to everyone. The characters are highly unlikeable and you can’t justify any of their actions, much like characters in Gone Girl and You; there’s no one to root for. So if you need at least one good, likeable character in order to enjoy a book, this certainly isn’t it. It surprised me because I didn’t know exactly how deep the mystery aspect of this book would play out, and it does delve pretty deep into the characters lives, actions and motives. But we get into that toward the last half of the book and it seemed kind of rushed to me, much too convenient and not exactly believable. That and the translation disconnect from time to time are the reason for my rating of this book. Probably not one I would re-read. </text></scrape>
