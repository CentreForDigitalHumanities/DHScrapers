Subjects: sociopaths, psychopaths, admitting to nothing, having no social conscious, having no conscious at all, no remorse, being self centered, making excuses, violence, believing the ridiculous as long as it is in their favor, inflicting harm upon others, and hatred. The beginning of the book is a total bore to me, the author goes on and on about the restaurant, the waiter, the entire staff at the restaurant, his obnoxious brother (in his opinion) that he detests, the food itself and the lack of quantity of the food, and the pinky finger of the waiter. About halfway into the book I was ready to toss it, but then it got interesting, or a least better, it finally got to what I thought the topic of the book was suppose to be about. I thought the subject of the book was suppose to be about something that their children had done and that the parents had gotten together at a restaurant to talk about it, but they don't really talk about it, except for a couple of sentences. The whole subject is brushed over. Why would anyone go to a restaurant to talk about such an incredibly sensitive and abhor-able subject - the answer - think of it as a play and the setting is a pretentious restaurant. SPOILEROkay, spoiler alert. This book is about a whole entire family of sociopaths, psychopaths, and self absorbed creeps, parents who should of never had a child, and that too is discussed, sort of. The whole book leaves you thinking about all these awful flaws in these "characters," but nothing gets resolved, it is just a brushing along of the topic of awfulness. Some may think it is about love for a child, but it is not because these individuals don't have the capacity to love anything. When I originally read this book I gave it two stars. I feel I need to change that rating because whenever I see this book I can't help but think about it and the people and their level of lowness as human beings. I realize that the author did an incredible job of creating characters with incredibly abhor-able personality traits that were very memorable and unfortunately we all know some people that aren't far off from these characters, and therefor I am giving it four stars. </text></scrape>
