"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."Tolstoy aside, this family is a myriad of contradictory facades."Food doesn't matter much in novels. Years will pass in a person's life without a single description of a snack. Not a moment between adverbs for a taco. No wonder so many characters in contemporary fiction are glum: They're not hopeless; they're hungry.Dutch author Herman Koch structures his entire plot around a five-course meal, going from aperitif to digestif. The novel was originally published in the Netherlands in 2009 and went on to become an international best-seller. It's the story of two couples meeting for dinner in a sophisticated Amsterdam restaurant, the type of place where every item on the menu practically comes with a birth certificate, and in very small portions."What ensues is dished up in much more than the meager portions.A crime that has shocked the nation is slowly revealed by a family desperate to protect its own.Set in the world of today with cellphones, answering machines, youtube and security cameras, the plot takes on a modern 'who done it?'But we, the reader, who think we know the truth, can't clearly anticipate the twists that will drive us to a shocking conclusion! The Dinner is an alarming drama. What these boys have done is nothing short of grotesque.Their crime could take place anywhere, but in the cultured metropolitan city of Amsterdam, the shock value is elevated!Where moral conscience should prevail, there exists a vacuum of empathy. To cover-up the crime at whatever cost drives the desperate disquieting conclusion. The parents' behavior is complex and chilling... not unlike the restaurant's final offering of frozen epicurean desserts!Caution...one may feel the need for fresh air!</text></scrape>
