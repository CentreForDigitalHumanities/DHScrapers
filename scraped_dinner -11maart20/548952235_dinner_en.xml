Said meal is being served at one of those pretentious restaurants where the maitre d has an expression on his face that appears as though he has just gotten a whiff of something that smells bad. The snobbery of the restaurant personnel in this book is written flawlessly. There are parallels with the plating of the food that are right on, all that was missing were those silly smeary squiggles of sauce on the plate that are meant to make the clientele "ooh" and "aah". My own dislike of this type of ostentatious dining establishment may play into this somewhat; it always makes me want to laugh when an obsequious waiter comes at me wielding one of those gigantic pepper mills or an oversized cheese grater. But we're not just talking about a routine dinner out, as is readily apparent from the synopsis and the reviews that are posted. For those of you who like your fiction firmly entrenched on the dark side, this is one you will want to consider. Family values have rarely been as alarming as the ones illustrated here. The ending is chilling and sheer perfection. </text></scrape>
