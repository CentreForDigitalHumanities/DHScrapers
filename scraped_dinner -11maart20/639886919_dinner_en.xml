Is it a good thing or a real shame that this was the first thing I read in my post #DCC2013 world?(view spoiler)[If this was a book about some nice, normal people with a monstrous son, it would've been so much better. Who wouldn't be appalled & compelled to read about some happy parents who are shocked that they have a murderer for a teenager? Sadly, this is not that book. Paul has some strange psychological ailment that’s never fully explained that he’s passed on to his son (that is somehow something that an amniocentesis could detect, which baffles me), so it’s kind of no wonder Michel is setting homeless people on fire. I'm surely a product of all the parenting books I've read; when Michel gets in trouble for breaking a window & Paul berates the shop owner, who after all has a perfectly legitimate reason to be pissed at this kid, I thought, "Hey dad, way to not turn that one into a teaching moment." However, this pales in comparison to Paul’s further acts of violence, punching school administrators & hurling pans of macaroni at his brother & so forth. It’s really no surprise that Michel has turned out the way he has & the terrible lengths that his parents will go to protect him would be a lot more shocking if they weren’t themselves such terrible people.
