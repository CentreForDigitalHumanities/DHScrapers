I enjoyed the set-up of having the book split into the sections of the dinner, and especially enjoyed the idea of these cutthroat parents going to extreme lengths to protect their children whilst trying to maintain civility at a dinner party. Unfortunately, the story took far too long to get to the crux of the dinner party, and felt rather restrained in it's delivery of the final plot points. A little too much was left ambiguous or unexplained, and only one character felt fully realised to me. It would have been interesting to get a narration from each of the parents, to understand their motivations further. The final conversation took far too long to arrive, and when it did, it was over too quickly. Overall an interesting plot, some stand-out details of food and snippets of conversation but ultimately left me 'hungry for more'. (Sorry) </text></scrape>
