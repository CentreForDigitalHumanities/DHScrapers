Seriously, the dude has issues! He seems so normal when the book starts. I make fun of people who point with their pinky too. I can see where is issues with his brother stem from. But as the book goes on, you start to casually realize how f'd up this guy is! Cray cray! :) I loved it. Quick read too!</text></scrape>
