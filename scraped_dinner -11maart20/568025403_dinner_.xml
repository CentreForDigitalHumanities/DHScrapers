The premise is good- each chapter is a course of the meal from beginning to end, all occurring on one night. Two couples, ( brothers), meet for dinner to talk about their sons( they each have one). Obviously, something is up and you want to know more. But, thats where the book falls short for me. The information is slow to come, the characters are boring and there is never really some climax that makes you want to keep reading.</text></scrape>
