So this was the second book we picked for my work book club (and a much better choice than last month's, I might add) and I am honestly so, so glad we picked this one. It was a wild, absolutely fantastic ride.So initially I was a little hesitant about this one because some of the reviews compared it to Gone Girl (and I absolutely hated Gone Girl so I usually try to stay clear of anything likened to it) but I honestly didn't see similarities between the two literally at all (except for maybe a slightly unreliable narrator? Though that's the whole premise for Gone Girl and, in this one, the narrator is only slightly unreliable?) Anyway. That's to say, this book was a really well planned and executed mystery.The only problems I did have with this one were with the narrator? Because the way this story was setup was weird?? It was almost like Paul was telling this story to the press or writing a book about it because there were times when he would withhold information claiming that "it wasn't his to divulge" which made it sound like he was telling this to the police or press or something. But that was never, ever covered???? (And, if I'm being truly honest here, almost felt like lazy writing to me? Like the author didn't want to come up with an actual disease for Claire so he just said it was something that he couldn't say. Same with Paul. It sounded like the author was just saving himself from doing more research. But that's just my opinion.)Honestly, the narration in this novel reminded me a lot of Lolita. Like it was the final memoir and the last chance he would have to share his story. Except that was just a question that was never answered. And that honestly bugged me a lot?Other than that, I really loved this book. It had really, really great pacing and setup. So often "popular" mysteries like to just keep building suspense to try to make the climax really powerful and end up with about a hundred pages of nothing happening before everything is just crammed into the last 50 pages. This book definitely didn't do that. It paced the story and would reveal pieces of the mystery before slinking back into the dinner party and leaving you wandering and waiting before dropping another piece. It was honestly exactly the way a mystery should be written.I also liked that this was a book that had a whole bunch of really unlikable characters but none of them were unlikable to the point that it made you want to stop reading. The story was interesting enough and all of the characters were flawed enough that it kept it intriguing.So basically this has been a million ways for me to repetitively say that I really love this book. I honestly wish someone else at my work had actually read this because I really, really wanted to talk about it. (And we also decided not to do book club anymore because I was the only one reading any of the books. So. Yeah.) So I HIGHLY recommend this book. If you're looking for a really great mystery (and definitely one with a lot of culture!) this one is the way to go. It's a wonderful, well plotted mystery that I will definitely be visiting again. I'm so glad I had the chance to read it!!</text></scrape>
