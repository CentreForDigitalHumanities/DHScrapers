I'm really sorry to Herman Koch, because you have written it really beautiful and it definetly wasn't the writing style I didn't like. It was the whole story and how the father deals with the secret his son has been living with. I just hated it. And I especially hated the father and his actions. And then his brother, ugh terrible. But again Herman Koch, my compliments because despite the fact that I hate your book, it is a really good book. I have talked to multiple people about it and everyone has such a clear opinion about it. It is a book where you can litteraly debate over. So for everyone who wants to read it, don't not read it because I hate the book, there are so much people out there who do like the book and it is a good book, I just didn't like the characters. </text></scrape>
