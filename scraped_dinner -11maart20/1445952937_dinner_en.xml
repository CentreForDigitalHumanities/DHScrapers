(Bumping it up to 5 stars on Goodreads, because it's over a month after I finished this and I keep thinking about it!) The Dinner deals with the problem of never being able to truly know someone else's motivations - not your brother's, not your spouse's and not even your child's. And when you do get a glimpse behind their facade, you might not like what you see... A fairly slow paced, yet still incredibly intense read that poses some really interesting questions. Highly recommended!</text></scrape>
