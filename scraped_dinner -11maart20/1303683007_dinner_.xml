Not my favorite books, but among the best, if that makes sense.The way things are slowly revealed, both Paul's character, who starts out seeming to be a loving, progressive family man...possibly just a little snarky to his politician brother. There are at first just small clues, but they snowball - his desire to see a fight at dinner, then his fantasy of the locals turning violent in Dordogne, the flashback to threatening a bike shop owner, the covering up for his son, and the revelations of the way he smashed his brother's face with a casserole dish and put his son's principal in the hospital. He is laid bare as a cold and remorseless psychopath.Less is seen of Michel, but Claire seems similar. The subject of the incident at the ATM is danced around, but it eventually becomes clear that everyone at the dinner knows. And while Serge wants to set things right in some way or another, and Babette is weepy all evening, there is none of that from either Paul or Claire. They show no guilt or sadness. Just practicality of the most selfish sort. They are so despicable that I love them. Or at least love what Koch has done in creating them. </text></scrape>
