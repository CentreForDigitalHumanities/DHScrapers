From the beginning, I disliked the narrator’s constant whining. (Even whines about his urine stream...seriously?). As his real character was revealed, I quickly grew to despise him...and every other character in the book. For those who put his characters “issues” down to mental illness: WHAT possible excuse can be assigned to all of the other people in this book? The story was so bizarre and disjointed, I honestly can’t imagine what we will discuss?! Best thing i can say about it—I am done. </text></scrape>
