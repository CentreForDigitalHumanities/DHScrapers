I have struggled to give it one star the only reason I rated it at all is because the author went to the trouble of writing it! This is an unpleasant book full of unpleasant characters. I got half way through and had to visit the Amazon website to look again at the reviews. They were nearly all 5 star reviews with glowing reviews of this dreadful book must be something wrong with me. I don't like to read of parents who will go to any and I mean any lengths to protect their sons from the horrible crimes they have been happily committing i.e. the killing of a homeless woman for fun and the beating of other homeless people for some kind of gratification. Maybe I am missing something but I would have least hoped these horrible characters would have got some kind of comeuppance by the end of this book. Horrible Book! Will not be looking for others by this author! Thank goodness I am now reading Narrow Dog to Wigan Pier" a pearl of a book which makes me laugh!</text></scrape>
