They didn't do it for me.I also didn't like that in a way all of the characters where horrible and not even one of them was a character that I enjoyed to read about. That doesn't mean that the book was horrible, it was okay, it was good as I already said, but at the same time it wasn't anything spectacularly world changing. It could have been made better, but it could have been worse. It's not really a book I know that I can recommend to people, simply because I am completely unsure how to feel and what to think about this myself, especially since I am not even sure what kind of genre this book falls into.This book is different and a bit strange, but overall interesting. The writing is sometimes a bit strange which I am not sure if it is the translation or the original work that has been writing in the strange never really getting a direct answer way of if the translated did that. If you love strange books give this a read.If you want a direct and clean cut book that has a start and a specific ending? Search for a different one! </text></scrape>
