It is disturbing. Insanely disturbing. I rarely felt so uncomfortable and so surprised while reading a book. This book touched every nerve. Poverty, racism, family connections, politics, violence. This is the pure difficulty. It makes you squirm.Two brothers and their wives meet for dinner. One is an aspiring prime minister of Holland and the other a former teacher. With each course of the meal stories unfold. Their children did something. But as the courses progress we get into the real meat of the story and no one seems completely blameless. Parents do awful things for their children. Children learn awful traits from their parents. How far would you go to protect your child and do you cross a line that stops protecting your child but starts protecting the idea of your child rather than the kid himself?The last section is called digestif, the digestion of the meal. Only ironically, I don't know how anyone could digest and let settle these characters actions. So damn good.</text></scrape>
