There are great books out there that explore how far parents will skew their moral compass in order to protect their offspring and family name. Personally, I didn't find that Herman Koch executed it as well as other writers did. The language was too provocative, the situation extreme and some of the 'facts' implausible, and never before have I read a book where pretty much every single character, even the peripheral ones, was repulsive and their values questionable. The most odious character of them all was the narrator, and that really made it tricky for me to enjoy the book fully. </text></scrape>
