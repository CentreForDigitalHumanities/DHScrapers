For example, I don't like tension and suspense, dark humor and deepening gloom, unreliable narrators. So Herman Koch's new novel, The Dinner, shouldn't be my type of book.I've been vetting books for next year's Buff Orpington Tournament. So I've read the first 30 to 50 pages of a lot of books that aren't my type just to get a feeling for whether they are any good, unappealing as I might find them. For example, Rachel Kushner's new novel, The Flamethrowers, is not a book that appeals to me at all. But I read 30 pages or so and I think it's a pretty good book, though I don't plan to read it. The Blue Book by A L Kennedy has been well received in some circles. I read the first 30 pages and from that much of the book I think I can say it's not really first-rate.Although I have liked Kate Atkinson's books in the past, her new one, Life after Life, strikes me as weak, so I didn't finish it. I was sure I'd love Tara Conklin's The House Girl. But I didn't think it was well written so although I had planned to read it, I didn't.Then came Herman Koch's book. Dark satire, uncomfortable, lacerating. I need none of these in my reading right now. Says The Economist: "The reader does not rise from his table happy and replete so much as stand up suddenly, pale and reeling. . . . Read The Dinner and taste the shock."With so much against it, really it's a surprise that I should read even so much as the first 30 pages. But I did and I was on page 44 before I thought to look up and see how much I had read. By page 110 there was no way I was going to leave the book unfinished. And I gulped it down, reading all but about 20 pages in one sitting.The story unfolds like peeling an onion - with just as sharp and astringent an odor. It's complex and subtle but sometimes hits you like a brick. I can't even tell you who the main characters are or what the book is about without spoiling the effect of constant puzzlement and surprising revelation. Normally, I go out of my way to find somebody who is willing to tell me the plot or a novel or movie and how it all turns out. I don't like suspense or surprises. This book depends on constant low level suspense and I ate it up. I know nothing about Dutch literature, and I had not heard of Herman Koch before this book popped up in translation in February. It has been popular in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe and I'm sure it will grow increasingly popular in the US.Here's what The Wall Street Journal said about it: It's a summer's evening in Amsterdam, and two couples meet at a fashionable restaurant for dinner. Between mouthfuls of food and over the polite scrapings of cutlery, the conversation remains a gentle hum of polite discourse -- the banality of work, the triviality of the holidays. But behind the empty words, terrible things need to be said, and with every forced smile and every new course, the knives are being sharpened. Read it.</text></scrape>
