I do not understand all the comparisons to Gone Girl (which for the record I did not like all that much) other than the underlying "the world is full of psychopaths" theme. This is so much better written than Flynn's book, and this book is heartbreaking and relatable and funny (notwithstanding the fact that everyone in this story is pretty deplorable) where Gone Girl was ridiculously contrived. This actually brought to mind the Twilight Zone episode with the evil child who turns people who annoy him into other objects or animals. I happened to be reading this when there was a story in the news about 300 kids who had broken into the house of a football player, had a party, and trashed the place. He had security footage and asked the kids on the tape to come clean up (pretty decent of him) and one showed up. When he posted video of the miscreants the parents SUED HIM. Very similar parenting style, though certainly far less serious a crime than the ones in the book (that is all I will say to keep this spoiler free.) For those readers who think the circumstances here are unrealistic, I will just assume none of you are upper middle class parents in the US or Europe. Is this enhanced? Sure it is. This is not a documentary but a parody which highlights the decimation of values, the dehumanization of inconvenient people, and the effects of cool mom and cool dad parenting. Very effective.</text></scrape>
