It’s NOTHING like Gone Girl. It took me forever to get through this book because I just didn’t care. Most of the book was nonsense and the story didn’t even start until the last 100 pages are so.Once the story FINALLY picked up, I feel like a lot of the writing was a cop-out. The narrator actually refuses to reveal a lot of details about his story, and you never even find out what illness he has. It seems like the author was too lazy to come up with these details, so he simply left them out.I think the icing on the cake was when the brother lost the election because he shaved his beard? Was this supposed to be satire? It’s probably a social commentary about something or other, but by this point the story lost any sense of relevance in my eyes.I was originally going to give this book 2 or maybe even 3 stars, but writing this review has made me so mad that I’m just going to give it 1. What a waste of time. </text></scrape>
