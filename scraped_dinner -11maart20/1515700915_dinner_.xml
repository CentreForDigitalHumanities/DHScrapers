Some will "dance for food". But what will you do for free books? I blog for books.I got this copy of the book for free from this website called Blogging For Books. It is a service similar to NetGalley but they also provide hard copies to members in exchange for a review. And it's not always an ARC or an upcoming release. This particular book was published in 29 October 2013. It has been made into two films with another one rumored to be directed by Cate Blanchett.The Dinner by Herman Koch is not my usual choice of reading material. I don't have much experience with literary fiction but I've dipped my finger into it in recent years. It takes on a more "serious" note; a big difference from the recent additions to my TBR. It is about two couples meeting up for dinner at an exclusive restaurant. One pair consists of a popular politician, Serge, and his wife, Babbette. The other couple is Paul and Claire. Paul is Serge's younger brother. We follow the story through his point of view. Both families have fifteen-year-old sons who grew up together. Serge has another son adopted from Africa. The two couples meet not only just for good food, they came together to discuss their sons. They've done something unspeakable and it was up to their parents to pick up the pieces.It took me a while to process this story. My version of the book is an English translation from the original Dutch by Sam Garrett. I found it a little bit stilted, the words didn't flow very well with each other. Split into four "courses", it is incredibly detailed and you're fed these details little by little. It progresses slowly - consistently slow - even if it jumped around every chapter. One moment, we're observing their dinner at present day; the next, we're given backstories on their respective families, relationships, and personal experiences. At first, it didn't really make sense. Why do we need to know that Serge has an adopted son? What's the point of establishing that Paul and Claire have a favorite cafe? All of that is a set up to make the reader either justify the ending or challenge it. I honestly was surprised it ended up the way it did but I thought it really didn't need ALL of that build up. Or it could be just the choppy translation.The book tackles a number of social issues. Up in front is the clear power of money and authority. Serge was slated to be the next Prime Minister. He could get an instant reservation at a restaurant with a six-month waitlist. It also shows the influence of being in power. They could make it just go away. But then, there's also the reality of the fragility of status. You spend your whole career building up your name and it only takes one person or event to have it all crumble down. Especially on Serge's part, he represents the importance of "looking the part". One can not be the sharpest tool in the box but you can compensate for that with charisma.I did like the story although I felt that the translation lost some of the magic of the original. Granted I have not read (and could not read) the Dutch version but I'm pretty sure that one has better flow to the words and story. I'm not taking anything away from the translator's work though. Being multi-lingual myself, I know how confusing it can be and what a huge task not only putting words into a different language but preserving the mood, meaning, and tone behind it. Overall, The Dinner is a great conversation piece for a book club. A lot of things can be dissected and analysed. Heck, you can even play the parts of the characters, see how you would react to their circumstances.Rating: 3/5.</text></scrape>
