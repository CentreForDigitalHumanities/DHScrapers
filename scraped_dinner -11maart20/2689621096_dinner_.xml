I’ve stepped in too many times to bail my son out of trouble and have had to learn to step back and let him take responsibility for his actions but I did find myself thinking - how would I react in this situation? I’d like to hope that I’d take a stronger moral standing than the unpleasant characters in this book - which also demonstrates that both nature and nurture have a lot to answer for. Not a fun read, but definitely thought provoking.</text></scrape>
