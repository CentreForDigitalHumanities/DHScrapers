It's a hard one to review. I was actually quite interested in the dinner portion of the story. The relationship of the 4 characters and why they were meeting on this particular night. I really disliked the tangents the narrator would go on however. A few would give insight to the temperament of the characters but overall they just fell very flat. The actual story about the dinner was quite interesting if not enjoyable, the characters are quite despicable, but reading portions of this novel was a slog.</text></scrape>
