Unfortunately, that was not the case. First of all, structurally it's a difficult read. I honestly wanted to put it down many times and actually skipped entire paragraphs that were obviously reiterating previous content (there is a lot of that). Secondly, the characters are not relatable by any stretch of the imagination. The author delves into Paul's background but because we are in Paul's head, the character himself omits a lot of information that would make the reader sympathetic to him. We have a vague notion that he has some kind of "illness" which requires medication, that he fails to take. It's hard to find sympathy when the character is controlling the narrative. What you're left with is a bunch of characters you feel nothing about. The only relatable thing in this book is a parent's desire to do anything to protect their children. You know where the story is heading as well as a guess as to how it ends about one third of the way through the book. The most horrifying thing about the storyline is the way a murder of a homeless person is dealt with. None of the characters have any real regard for that person and feel no need to punish their children over it. If the intent was to make me feel absolutely repulsed by most of the characters, then job well done. Absolutely a disappointing read.</text></scrape>
