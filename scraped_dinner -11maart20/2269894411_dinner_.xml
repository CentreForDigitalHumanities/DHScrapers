I vaguely thought of Huntington's, but it was strongly implied that the syndrome was also the cause of Michel's violence, which would not have been the case with Huntington’s (Michel is only fifteen). And then I found out that Koch partly inspired him self of — of all things — Asperger's. What. The. What.To start with the obvious, Asperger's is not detectable in utero. Second, aspies are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Third, as the mother of a child who has (what used to be known as) Asperger’s, I find the unchallenged opinion of the psychiatrist that it would be best to have an abortion if you could tell your child had it profoundly repulsive (he lumps in kids with DS too). So while this book is a dark (I like dark) sometimes uproariously funny page-turner, it’s now deeply tainted by my repulsion of the way Kock thinks of autistic people. Hence the one star.</text></scrape>
