As you go with two couples to a dinner at a fancy restaurant, the layers are peeled away as the courses are served. The surprises keep coming as you get closer and closer to the shocking center. Lots of funny comments about modern restaurant fare with the disturbing plot revelations. The ending left me with some unanswered questions that bear some discussion with another reader. No more to say without spoiling it, but it is worth your time.</text></scrape>
