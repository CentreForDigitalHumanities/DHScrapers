Fuck this book. Fuck everything this nasty, nihilistic, pretentious novel wants to be and everything it actually is.Call me sensitive if you want, but I just can't get behind a story whose utterly reprehensible characters have their violence, hatred, and racism go completely unchecked. While I'm not opposed to writing with a mean streak (I enjoyed Gone Girl, which this book is frequently compared to), it's usually tempered with a dark sense of humor, compelling plotting and suspense, and/or characters that exhibit glimpses of humanity or relatability. The Dinner has NONE of those qualities. The slowly building sense of unease is often interrupted by long, tedious flashbacks whose payoffs don't merit the amount of time spent discussing them even if they DO illuminate the nuttiness of the nutcase narrating this story. The flashbacks ruin the tension, and it takes nearly half the story before we find out what terrible deed the children actually committed, and it isn't until nearly the end that the main characters attempt to confront this hard truth and even THAT is interrupted with flashbacks and rendered with a stunning lack of empathy. There's just not enough momentum to propel this "story", especially on audio when I couldn't just skim through all of the mind-numbing minutiae to get to what I originally thought was going to be the meat of the story.(view spoiler)[I hate that the narrator's violence - and his son's - is explained away as a genetic defect. It's a cop-out that cheapens the whole story and makes the narrator into something "other", stripping him of humanity even further. I especially couldn't get inside his head after that, never mind it's complete implausibility. You can't predict behavioral abnormalities through prenatal screenings, and this whole plotline was so ridiculous and completely ruined whatever kind of statement on violence Koch was trying to make. Also, I was hoping against hope that they wouldn't plot to kill Bo, and I was sooooooo pissed off when it actually came to fruition. (hide spoiler)]I haven't been this angry since I nearly walked out of the movie Olympus Has Fallen, which provoked the exact same kind of angry, ranting reaction I had with this book here, for many of the same reasons. It's dumb, blindingly violent, and the longer I watched it unfold, the more resentful of the experience I became. Do yourself a favor and forget about this book.</text></scrape>
