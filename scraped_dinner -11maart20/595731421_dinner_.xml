And that's a wonderful feeling! Herman Koch delivers a startling novel with a very narrow framework: two families at dinner, discussing their children. The thing is, though, that Paul, Claire, Serge, and Babette Lohman aren't discussing the trivialities of raising (read: managing) teenagers; rather their sons Rick and Michel have committed a violent crime, and they need to decide what to do about it. For a full-length book with a novella-sized premise, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth, emotion, and intensity of this entire work. I know what you're thinking when I mention that a violent crime committed by teenagers is the crux of this novel. You're probably imagining Rick and Michel beating the shit out of some dweeb in gym class, or habitual bullying a la Carrie. You might even be imagining something as atrocious as this year's Steubenville case. But it's worse than that: (view spoiler)[Rick and Michel bludgeon a homeless woman sleeping in an ATM cubicle, and then set her on fire. Not only that, but the entire crime is lauded on Youtube, and will remain so unless Rick and Michel can pay off Rick's adopted brother, Beau. Serge's political career and the boys' futures are all on the line.  (hide spoiler)]I know, right? INTENSE. In addition to the crime, Koch also fleshes out a violent family history building up to this crime, peppered with social and racial issues affecting Holland, and the darkest, most twisted drives of each and every member of this family. (Well, except for maybe Babette. Poor Babette.) My one point of contention is perhaps the treatment of adoption. Beau is strangely vilified beyond his brother and cousin, even though his crime is not nearly as detestable as theirs. Furthermore, his punishment is (view spoiler)[probably death at the hands of Rick and Michel, with the entire family covering it up. (hide spoiler)] That's so unbelievably fucked up, but it didn't exactly dampen my enjoyment of the novel. Perhaps this was Koch's intention, to further expose the hollowness of Dutch social standards that would sacrifice the lesser son for the preservation of blood ties. Otherness, both on racial and familial levels, is insurmountable (and possibly fatal) in this novel; but again, I hate everyone in this book, so I'm not surprised by their choices. The events herein are unsettling and thought-provoking, and make for a sucker punch of a book. Seriously, I did not see this coming, Holland. Buy this title from Powell's Books.PS- WHY is everyone comparing this to Gone Girl? Both horrible families, I guess. But I would more readily compare this to We Need to Talk About Kevin. DERP. </text></scrape>
