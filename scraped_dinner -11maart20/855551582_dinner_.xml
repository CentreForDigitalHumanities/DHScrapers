It was loathed by trusted reading friends (Hi Amy! Hi Joanna). It was dubbed the European 'Gone Girl' -- I don't tend to like those comparisons to start off with, but on top of that a lot of folks seemed to be offended by it. Speaking of offending, I detected the subject matter was offensive to many and while that never stops me from reading a book, it did not exactly encourage me either. And finally, there were many who seemed to be troubled by the Dutch translation of the novel, making me think it was unreadable.Given that you have already seen how many stars I rated the book, you can see that ultimately hardly any of the above came into play in my reading of this novel. While I won't disagree that they 'Gone Girl' comparisons are there because of socio-/psycho-pathic characters, I'd offer that both had hyper-realistic/over-the-top characters which makes for some very dark humor. Now this is not saying that anything that any of the truly disturbing things that happen in either book are funny, but it is the "are they really going to go there" that provided the entertainment. Again, I feel very cringe-y even saying that given the unsavory material, but I am not sure how seriously/literally we are supposed to take the story which I think ultimately comes down to a morality play, a nature-vs-nurture debate, and a dip into the human psyche and mental illness.Likewise, I didn't experience any issues with the writing (or translation). I zipped through it in quite quick fashion and was always pulled into reading it with its fairly brief chapters, a true page turner for me.I am glad to have not really known what this book was about (other than there was a dinner and something awful happens/happened -- no details), so there were still some surprises along the way. Still the "will never know" aspect is what I would have thought if I came into it with a "clean" opinion. Perhaps if I read it when first published with its buzz and those 'Gone Girl' comparisons, I would have shrugged. But these many months later with lowered expectations and ready for plenty of issues, The Dinner ended up over-achieving. (P.S. Would have loved a book club on this one given the divisiveness).</text></scrape>
