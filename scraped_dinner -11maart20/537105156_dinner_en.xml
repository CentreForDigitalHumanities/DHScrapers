As birth control, this was phenomenal. It does provide 1 or 2 shockers, but these are towards the end and are mixed into an excess of meandering chit chat and mundane flashbacks. On the upside, I do look forward to discussing this in my bookclub as it provides the opportunity for heated discussion lines, but if reading solo, I wouldn't recommend it.

Favorite Quote: N/A. No highlights made I'm afraid.

First Sentence: We were going out to dinner.</text></scrape>
