I disliked reading every single page! Every stinkin character I loathed, they were all so shallow and rotten. I couldn't wait til the end so I didn't have to read anymore. Why not stop reading it you ask? Well, because I was keeping the faith, that by the end they would do the right thing...but no, they stayed ugly til the bitter end.</text></scrape>
