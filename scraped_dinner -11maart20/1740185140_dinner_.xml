I wasn't expecting any of that! actually I thought it was going to be a lot more obvious in terms of an exciting sort of a thriller. But it was surprisingly very different from what I was expecting, and it exceeded my expectations. I loooooooove the format of the book, how everything is divided in courses, it's very cleverly done and it suits the story, narration perfectly and it makes it very unique. The characters are not likeable at all, but to me a book with such unlikeable set of characters that captures my attention and keeps me interested and dying to know how everything is going to end up, how things are going to be resolved, deserves my respect. The first part of the book it's filled with mostly descriptions, narration of a very mundane, everyday sort of things, but you just feel that this is the build up for something special. We get a glimpse of the main character, the narrator's life, and it's so wonderfully written, the descriptions are so detailed and the narration it's so engaging, that I could only confirm that this is the work of an excellent story teller, one who no matter how unattached you could be from their characters behaviors and how questionable their action are, you can't help to feel completely mesmerize and invested in the story.And then... it happens. Things start to unfold little by little, always accompanied by a very logical explanation that makes you feel like you are actually rooting for those people, that makes you question even your own beliefs. The entire problematic, the main plot in this book it's presented with such subtlety, that you actually get on Paul's side! the way he sees and reacts towards society, it's twisted in some kind of way, but, again, the way Herman Koch presents us those beliefs, that argument that Paul's offers when he encounters moral and social paradoxes it's incredibly well done and very convincing. I love the message intertwined between this story, again, so subtle but so powerful. And always with a touch of humor that had me laughing out loud a couple of times. I think Claire is the character that surprised me the most, she has very sociopath tendencies hidden in a very well crafted character.The only thing that stopped me from giving this book a five star rating was the ending. It felt really abrupt and sudden, you could almost say it was a bit anticlimactic. It reminded me a lot to Nightfilm by Marisha Pssel even thought those books are completely almost opposite, but it's a very similar sort of rhythm in the story towards the end when you get to a high very high and you suddenly descend, but seeing it from an abstract point of view, it's sort of similar to Paul's behavior and the disorder that he suffers from. 100% recommend.</text></scrape>
