Written by a Dutch author and has been wildly popular all over, it has, at its center very unlivable characters. I would compare this book and it’s characters as similar to that of Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiasm. This book explores upper middle class Dutch society and with much black humor, picks it apart in a very Larry David-like quality. The book is told over a dinner at a high-end restaurant and while we peel away layers of what has brought these two couples together for this dinner we explore the different courses. While many might find the food and courses distracting it felt quite apt to me. As we get further into the courses we get deeper into the nuts and bolts of the sordid, criminal reason for this dinner. I was gripped by this book from the beginning, sadly, I felt it lost some steam midway through the main course. The author presented us with one of the dinner guests as the narrator, and we learn he’s not quite what he appears. Flashbacks are used, quite deftly, to weave between the purpose of the dinner and the dinner itself. However, there were times I felt we deviated too far. A worthy read, or listen for me, but I felt too much was left to the last few pages and felt a bit anti-climactic in some ways. </text></scrape>
