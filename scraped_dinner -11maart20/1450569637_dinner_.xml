I did not read a single review...I did not do any google research that I typically do. I went in completely blind...cause I like to live on the edge?? Maybe...nah, I just wanted to take a chance on it without any outside influence. Am I glad that I did??...well duh, here's the review:For one, can I just say I loved the cover. Great cover...love the hole and severe burn where a plate should be...so fitting to the story...very symbolic of the journey you are about to take!! This is a totally uncomfortable book and I say that in a good way. How so you wonder??.. I just believe that Herman Koch's intentions are to make us uncomfortable as we read every single page, every single line, get deep into the lives of the characters in this story, be in the moment, and it delivers. So we start off with the narrator of the story, Paul Lohman...Mr. Curmudgeon, I get that from the start. He goes on with the entire story in a complaining state...entitled..slightly annoyed...bitter that he has a successful brother..resentful of his brother's success at career, marriage, and life in general...Serg Lohman, whose status and money affords him the ability to get into some of the most exclusive eateries. Waiting lists??...what's that for Serg Lohman!! There is a dinner that is to take place between the not so successful Paul and his wife Claire...to meet with Serg Lohman and his beautiful and just as fabulous wife Babette. Chapter upon chapter we get the bitter Paul feeling oh so injusticed by Serg's success. It had me laughing a little and almost relating...even if it is an absolutely disgusting thing to admit. There is another story within that story and that's where it gets even more crazier..even more distorted...even more sickening. A revolting crime that involves his son Michel and Serg's two sons...but more than that it is how Paul describes the whole thing...his take on this very seriously perterbing matter. We are expected to hate the very 'pompous' Serg if Paul could have his way about things but our opinions, at least mine, makes me think much deeper into Paul's resentments and what that tells about him as a person.The thing I loved about this story is that we are taken through a fancy schmancy dinner in a very fine restaurant between 4 very different very dysfunctional people..all the elaborate and exquisite courses...and through each of these food adventures and Paul's narrative another cryptic story is unfolding. The way it is done is unique and amazing and I could not get enough. It reads very slow but I don't mean that in a negative way....highly suspenseful to the point of almost irritating....I LOVED it. It's one of those books that you just can't put down...you think each page is gonna give you something you need to know...but no...you have to wait for one other page..and one other page more....gripping and addictive!! And as you go along you know you are waist deep in something quite disturbing. It reminds me very much like The Lottery by Shirley Jackson. It gives me that exact same perverted feel. A gruesome car accident that you drive slowly to see if you can catch a glimpse at carnage even though you know you shouldn't.This is the book to read if you like suspense but the kind that in a way can almost be construed as slow because it doesn't reveal itself by simply jumping out at you...it makes you wait...it takes you on it's journey. This is the book to read if you can find yourself highly disturbed and be ok with that. This is the book...PERIOD. I absolutely loved it. It took me a few days after I actually read the entire thing to write a review because I wanted to stew on how the story made me feel. A week later the book has not left me...I am haunted by the story..and that is always a good thing. This is one of those books you will not easily forget.Thanks to Herman Koch for his genius portrayed on paper and for the peeps at http://bloggingforbooks/ for making my request possible...I received this book free in exchange for an honest review and honest review I did give. Again, Thanks!! You can check out my review of this book and many others at http://dalaimommadrama.blogspot.com/</text></scrape>
