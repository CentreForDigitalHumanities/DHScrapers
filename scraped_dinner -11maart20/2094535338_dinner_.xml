You gradually find out what exactly is the realtionship of the 2 couples that will uave dinner. Kind of slow at first, but then my interest spiked up because of a mystery (what did the two teenage boys did?)After a while, the structure kind of got lost, some chapters were full flashback without really being tied to the dinner. I liked the fact that I gradually discovered (mild spoiler) that the narrator was not reliable.I liked what the writer tried to do with this book. He had many good ideas, the narrator, the dinner structure. But I have a feeling he could have done all of these a little better. Maybe if the book was bigger, he would have more space to develop his ideas. I did not like that much the lack of moral dilemma about the homeless people. I was left with the feeling that this book suggests homeless people deserve to be punished. I guess this is because of the narrator, but maybe there could be more opposing views from other people in the book.In any case, I read it in a day, it has some nice ideas, I would say read it. I don't know if the movie will be as good as the book, I think you really have to read the narrators thoughts.</text></scrape>
