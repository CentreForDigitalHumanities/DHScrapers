Invariably the book being compartmentalized within the Gone Girl genre is a comparative disappointment. The Dinner is marketed as "A European Gone Girl ..." This comparison tainted my view of The Dinner! Don't get me wrong, The Dinner is an interesting and highly entertaining read, laced with darkness, a warped sense of mortality and an incessant undercurrent of blossoming and ominous mental illness, but far from extraordinary that is Gone Girl. Employing the Gone Girl branding mechanism raises expectations but in this case, The Dinner under delivered relative to my heightened expectations. Such a pity.The story takes place over dinner arranged by the Lohmans. Serge Lohman is the cabinet minister and head of the opposition party, a shoe in for Prime Minister in upcoming elections six months away. Serge’s brother Paul taught high school history ten years ago before circumstances forced him to step away from education. Along with their wives Babette and Claire, the Lohmans meet at a very exclusive restaurant to talk about their children. How should they handle the dark secret about the children?Secrets. Family secrets. Personal secrets. This book is full of them. The threads of secrecy and subtle, nuanced communication is so ubiquitous in this read that narrator Paul Lohman informs the reader outright the details are none of your business! We learn about the neurological disorder but nothing more, except that maybe, just maybe, if amniocentesis was available decades earlier the pregnancy might have had a different outcome. We’re informed about the many surgeries Claire endured but specifics are purposefully omitted. Even the name of the hospital is personal information the reader has no business knowing! The secrets, winks and nods force the reader to develop their own perceptions of the Lohman families, perceptions that twist and turn in the wind as revelations about each family are offered by Paul during the aperitif, appetizer, main, desert and digestif courses. What at first looks and feels like an examination of the moral boundaries a parent will test and challenge to protect their children turns into something far more dark and sinister. Overall a quick, easy, very well written story with each chapter concluding with a mini cliff hanger that urged me on chapter after chapter. The flow was great and the events and revelations that slowly exposed the true nature of Paul Lohman were delicious! I just wish I never saw the words Gone Girl on the book cover.This is NOT Gone Girl … this is The Dinner. Read it!</text></scrape>
