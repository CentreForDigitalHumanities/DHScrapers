Fans of families, home and hearth should read this. Families should read it together, gathered around the hearth with hot cocoa. Children are never too young to learn the important lesson that family comes first.A false note that I found irritating: have you ever been to a restaurant, high-end or really any kind, where the waiter or manager points directly at the food when explaining what it is? Particularly with his pinky, inches from the food? I don't think this happens. Also at this supposedly super high-end restaurant, where you had to wait six months for a reservation, the courses were so ordinary. Goat cheese with arugula? Sorry, no one waits six months for a chance to eat goat cheese and arugula. It would have been more convincing if he'd made use of the wacko menu items at places like Noma or el Bulli.</text></scrape>
