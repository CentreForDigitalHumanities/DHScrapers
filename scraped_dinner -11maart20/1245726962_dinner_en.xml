It didn’t, though it works perfectly fine on a “nasty, brutish, and short” psychological thrillerish sort of way. Length apart—I knocked this back in a couple of hours—the publishers’ comparisons of it with Gone Girl don’t seem too far off. It’s a decent rainy-afternoon read, but nothing more. I think it was the cultural aspect of the book that intrigued me most, although it didn’t cash out. The Dutch setting had a certain novelty for me, and I was hoping that the novel would give some kind of insight into the darker aspects of a country legendary for its civilization and tolerance, yet also capable of producing some of the most violent soccer fans in Europe. The Dinner makes gestures towards this kind of cultural-political investigation (one of the protagonists is a politician; another, a history teacher); yet it never really delivers on that front. The Dinner is riven with implausibilities, but the restaurant setting looms large among them, as others have commented. The notion of a tale of violence and mayhem unfolding within the highly formalized structure of a high-end restaurant meal is a very neat one, with a built-in Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie-type element of social commentary, but for that to work, the restaurant frame has to be accurately rendered. It really doesn’t work here. None of the dishes the diners order sound faintly liked anything you might find in a restaurant of the type described, and the (not exactly novel) satire of nouveau cuisine preciousness falls fatally flat as a result. </text></scrape>
