I think I kind of hated it? but I also didn't want to stop reading it? I'm so confused! I am certain, however, that I loathed the main character - & disliked every other character; except I didn't dislike his wife until after dessert was served. random thought: how is Paul not in more trouble than he is? also, how in the heck do you pronounce their son's name?! Michel - I started out saying "Mitchell", but that later turned into "Michael". anyways, the book made me mad. their kids made me mad. their parenting decisions made mad. the ending made me mad. I'm just mad. I do like that the book literally took place over a 4 course meal (with some flashbacks to help character development) - but most of it really just felt like babbling.</text></scrape>
