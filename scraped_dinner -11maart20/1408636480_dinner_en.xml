That’s precisely the question posed in Herman Koch’s fantastic novel, The Dinner. Although I consider myself to be an avid reader, this was one that I just could not put down. With every turn of the page, I found myself on the edge of my seat dying to know what was going to happen next. Would it be dramatic? Unexpected? Devastating? No matter the outcome, I was always left wanting more – in my opinion, exactly how a truly great book should feel.The story takes place in a restaurant that is intended to feel fancier than most places, and it certainly felt fancier than anywhere I’ve ever been. Over the course of an extended multi-course dinner, two couple (the husbands whom are brothers) discusses their lives, what they have been doing since their last meeting, and other unimportant over-dinner small talk. But there’s always that feeling that something is being left out, that there’s something that’s going unsaid from all parties. Slowly but surely we, the readers, are made aware of what’s going on in everyone’s head – their children have been involved in an unthinkable, horrible act and they must decide what they are going to do about it. But it’s not as easy as just handling the situation as a family. No, it goes far, far beyond that and you’ll never guess what they ultimately decide upon.The true spotlight here must be on Koch’s characters. Each one is so dynamic and so passionate about their every movement, their every word that you can’t help but want to get to know each one in more depth. Even the spontaneous flashbacks into their pasts leave your heart racing and feeling like you can breathe in the very air that they are speaking into. Very rarely do you come across a book where the characters mesh so perfectly that you can hardly believe they were made within the mind of a man. But this work does that and far more.If you love books that leave you guessing, yet satisfied with their ending, if you loved Gone Girl, if you love the experience of getting to know each character and feeling what they do right alongside of them, if you love dinners that seem more for show than anything, or even if you find yourself in the food service industry dealing with customers that value themselves far more than they should – pick up this book. This book might single handedly take it’s rightful spot at the top of my to-recommend list because it’s one that I think brings value to every reader – no matter their direction in life. Political, but fun. Intimate, but welcoming. Brutal and dark, but in the greatest way. I cannot recommend this book more. Do yourself a favor and be sure to pick it up, then keep it handy so that you can share it with everyone you know afterward.WEBSITE | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM</text></scrape>
