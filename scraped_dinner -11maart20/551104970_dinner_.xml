Kretchmer</author><rating>liked it</rating><text>Like Gone Girl, I had mixed reactions to this dark novel. I am normally a huge fan of the flawed character and the unreliable narrator, and in this way the novel was stellar. It kept me turning the page even as I was distraught, even disgusted, by some of the attitudes of the characters. Perhaps I was hoping for redemption.It was also accessible, with spot-on dialogue, and the narrator's voice was fresh and clear. Structurally, the alternating scenes between present and past worked for me, although I felt there were certain parts of backstory that needed to be more fully developed or explained - especially regarding the multiple hospitalizations of the narrator's wife, Claire.But...and this is a bit of a spoiler alert: I found it tragic that all of the central characters, including the narrator, showed little-to-no compassion for the homeless victim of the crime central to the story. In fact, the only character who allegedly had any feeling about it was a distant character whom we never met in person. Later acts of violence were also presented so matter-of-factly that I had difficulty accepting this, even if the narrator was mentally ill and off his meds. Other characters were equally cold, which distracted from the credibility. I also was peeved at the references, late in the game, to the differences in how a parent might care about an adopted child versus a biological child. Clearly the author is out of his realm in this presentation of a very serious issue which essentially sprung up at the end; a theme that was worthy of more discussion throughout the story, especially given the controversial position his characters took at the end.As one reviewer said, the story can, in its own way, take away your appetite, and this was the case for me.</text></scrape>
