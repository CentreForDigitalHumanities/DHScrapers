A dinner with witty, clever, but nasty conversation, a dinner, perhaps, at which people's live might unravel (a sit-down Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?). But in fact, most of the book consists of back-story well away from the dinner table. I liked the dinner parts the best. There were some very funny moments there. But I wasn't particularly interested in the events that, it turns out, the book is really about.</text></scrape>
