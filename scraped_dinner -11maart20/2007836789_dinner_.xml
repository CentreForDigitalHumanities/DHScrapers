It took so much effort to keep reading. All the characters are unlikeable. The narrator is a dick, and his wife and son are extremely unlikeable. The fact that they would have their murderer son kill his cousin to cover up another murder is such crazy logic. The second premeditated and vicious. The incessant pointing out details that are useless and bring nothing to the story and omitting things that will fill in the blanks is infuriating.Glad I've finished this book because it's going back to the library and I never have to read it again. </text></scrape>
