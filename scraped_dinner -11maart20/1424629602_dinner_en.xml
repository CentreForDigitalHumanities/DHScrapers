My minimal enjoyment of this book came from the fact that I was listening to the audiobook. I really really enjoyed the narrators voice and his absolutely perfect way of reading this story to me. The actual story itself though was not great.The concept of this book was so intriguing to me. A dinner where 2 couples go to talk about something horrible their children did. Perfect. A great mystery. The reality was more of random pieces of a man's life that he talks about that have nothing to do with the dinner. The book itself starts out well enough. The main character goes to dinner. Perfect. But there's something absolutely annoying about how many times the main character got sidetracked to other topics. Example: there's a scene where he's standing with his son outside the restaurant and we somehow end up learning about his wife in the hospiital 10 years previous and he spends a full page talking about why he wanted to be clean shaven. Just a lot of useless crap that has nothing really to do with the Dinner. infact, the dinner in the book is a minor setting.The characters were okay. I liked the main character and his wife till the end but otherwise everyone is really unlikeable. I don't have much else to say about this. It's not terrible, I wouldn't recommend it or anything but I won't tell people not to read it. Read some reviews and the blurb and if you find yourself wanting to read it then I'd say try it out. </text></scrape>
