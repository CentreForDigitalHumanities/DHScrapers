But this is just a book site, so instead here’s a lot of mutterings about a very popular Dutch novel. Can’t rate this. It’s not only a case of being unable to escape the snobbery about a bestseller (even a very unusual one that’s translated from a European language whilst not being a detective novel) and whether to agree with or contradict the attendant sneering. Confusingly, the book was substantially better than I expected for quite a while, then near the end it got much worse than it seemed it would. Or was I just not getting the intended construction? * The Dinner is also pretty difficult to discuss without spoilers, and especially without revealing more than I knew before reading: two sets of parents meet at a restaurant to discuss their children’s involvement in the crime of beating up a tramp; it has been the subject of lots of discussion at book groups and online, practically none of which I’ve read. It turned out to be a first person narrative by a father. Struggling at the start to describe its milieu and tone, I realised … Mumsnet: very definitely middle class, educated but not intellectual, possibly even anti-intellectual, and relentlessly, tediously fond of sneering without being funny. Judgy.There were a few features of the narrative which seemed strange initially, but these were pretty much all explained by the last third of the book.I’d heard about the book prompting debate on a few issues: to what extent parents should pry into teenagers’ lives, various features of modern western society and how they may affect some young people’s behaviour, and a subtitle or cover line to some editions, “how far would you go to protect your family?” Nearing the end of the novel, these seemed tangential to what’s more of a character study of types who’ve also been examined in a few modern classics.(view spoiler)[Or in TV and film – a nuclear family of psychopaths who have the morals of Mafia kingpins, here disguised as slightly troubled , well-connected Dutch middle class people. The questions from the beginning of the book, especially about the pointlessness and unlikeliness of withholding various bits of information, the reason for meeting at a restaurant, and the relentlessness of the tone, are all answered as the litany of episodes of violence, incongruous calm, imperviousness to pain, and unempathic, unquestioned hatred of many types of people scrolls up like a check-list. (There are hints that the narrator may have been misdiagnosed as Asperger’s – overstimulus, something named after a German neurologist - but not all of that episode adds up – e.g. its detectability via amniocentesis. Perhaps that’s meant to be futuristic or fantasy. Hopefully I don’t sound too nannyish, but when a book makes that hint and sells millions, you have to hope it doesn’t adversely affect how people treat perfectly harmless real aspies they may meet.) Koch is quite clever at “implicating” the reader, initially making the narrator get annoyed by certain things that countless fairly decent people are annoyed by, about which one often reads grumpy press articles. As with many of these narrators who gradually turn out to be sinister criminals, the undoubtedly intended memory of partial identification, as you find out just what the person has done, leaves a feeling of grubbiness and an unwelcome need to “other” people, so as to pinpoint what separates oneself from a monster. Many people share his inverted snobbery – a short time reading online comments will attest to that – but for me one of the definitive breaks came in the scene about the bike shop. I was effectively brought up, via countless examples, to be rude and demanding to customer service staff if anything wasn’t right. Pull rank/class, cite or twist regulations, threaten to make formal complaints, yes, but hints of violence never ever - and his smug calm coldness was the very opposite of the excess anger I witnessed so often. (What actually changed me was not simply being on the other side of the counter – for in those roles I believed in my own duty to be very polite, apologetic, always to try and avoid the possibility of customer complaint, to expect ranting as the customer’s right, and to listen to it attentively unlike many others – but cumulatively noticing how very few people are actually angry like that. That it wasn’t normal after all, and even people who had high-ranking jobs or appeared wealthy were nice, and if they had to be terse, were generally polite. It was only when, briefly, doing telesales of dubious legality on lists which had already been overcalled that I ever heard the rate of temper-losing customers that I’d once thought dealing with the public involved. Even so, it’s still kind of ingrained and if I’m not feeling brilliant it’s an effort to be nice in the face of poor service, especially on the phone, and part of me wants someone to say “well done” afterwards for not shouting at that call centre operative.) For about two thirds of the way through the book, there’s something fairly plausible about it all. At first it just seems like the character is lacking in sense of humour or a capacity for joy, showing the initially fairly “charming”, “normal” sides of this psychopath-next-door as you might first meet him. But with the attack on the teacher, the complete lack of consequences from it and the subsequent mounting-up of events, it starts to get really silly. Is this meant to hint at a fantasy or delusion in the manner of American Psycho? … The novel seems to be saying something about the excessive lenience of the Dutch legal system, but is that accurate or fair, or a way of grandstanding for some Netherlandish Daily Mail equivalent? (hide spoiler)]I’m not so fond of reading fiction from countries I know very little about, not to be able to understand any political points in context, or have the faintest idea how usual an attitude or behaviour is there. (Okay, I read two Dutch novels in succession to try and get some sense of place but both were suspense-based and not exactly suited for that.) Talk about the liberality of the Dutch legal system here, for instance – how justified is that? Is that a right-wing position and how extreme? Is Serge a typical Dutch politician? (He sounds like a pretty typical British one… But the narrator isn't exactly unbiased.) Sometimes novels do tell you something as well: about the herds of upper-middle-class Dutch people with summer homes in the Dordogne, thinking they’re friends with local artisans, who actually only put up with them because they pay well. How many articles have I read since before A Year in Provence saying that’s what British people do? And the narrator talks about it as if it’s just the Dutch! In Britain, or even more so the USA, it seems unlikely that a school teacher would say “normal people with healthy minds see capital punishment as inhuman”: it’s far too mainstream – normal - a view to criticise so many of the population, parents and pupils that way. A small book I read last month, Multiculturalism by Ali Rattansi, helped. The Dutch approach comes close in practice to “multiculturalism” as critics in other countries here describe it, in a way that’s inaccurate about many areas of Britain. The Dutch form stems from a set of traditions called “pillarisation”, in which people of different Christian denominations led lives very separate from one another: education, work, some public facilities. This was applied to immigrants from abroad when they arrived in large numbers, and they were actively encouraged to identify with their own country and not so much with the Netherlands. Only more recently have attempts to greater integration started. This helped in understanding attitudes to racism in The Dinner - there are characters who spout views characteristic of liberal America in some contexts, there’s the idea that this is mostly for show, and that an African immigrant could never really be a Dutchman. As a novel, The Dinner, whilst competent, didn’t really do much that was new. As a discussion prompt or issue-driven fiction it does its job; it’s not a book you’d go to for style and creative use of language, though some of the details were well done. * I've since read a couple of blog posts and newspaper reviews which call it a satire. That certainly explains the increasingly over-the-top plot. It's a bit daft trying to comment on the effectiveness of a satire about a country I know little about. (How would non-Brits have seen What A Carve Up?... That was at least more entertaining than The Dinner and, as I understood it at the time, didn't use such a very well-worn type of narrative.) Trying to imagine that The Dinner is British doesn't quite work as a way of assessing it because the discussed level of leniency in the criminal justice system and general forgiveness isn't so prevalent - except perhaps in the eyes of some particularly rabid right-wingers. Seeking out reviews by Dutch people who share my views would be the only way of getting a clearer idea, but my hunch is that the stance of this book is further right than I am. If taken as a political statement rather than a character study of a family, it conflates reasonable and unreasonable practices and implies contemporary liberal society is creating certain types who have in fact always existed for other reasons. </text></scrape>
