Entertaining story. About two couples having dinner in a posh restaurant. One of them the soon to be prime minister. Their kids have done something 'bad'; which is the core of the story, how do you handle this as a parent? Are your kids like you? And all about what goes on in posh restaurants. Now that I read all my books in English I do have to get used to the Dutch language again. I find Dutch literary books often 'pretentious' and artificial in style of language, but Herman Koch keeps it pretty much down to earth. Think I will try another Dutch book soon. Actually 3,5 stars for this one.</text></scrape>
