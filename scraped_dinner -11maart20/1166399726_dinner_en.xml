I found the early stages to be very wordy. The narrator, Paul Lohman, seemed to diverge off the track of telling his story, going off on tangents, grizzles about the restaurant which is the setting for this book, jumping around with a series of past events and ideas...it was hard for me to engage. What's the main story-line, where is this narrative going??Then there comes a point in the book when things clarify. Paul and his wife Claire are having Dinner in a trendy Dutch restaurant with his brother Serge and sister-in-law Babette. They have agreed to get together to discuss what to do about their sons, Michel and Rick, who have committed a serious crime. Serge is a well-known politician, aspiring to be the next Prime Minister of the Netherlands, so he has a definite need to sort out the issues arising from his son's and nephew's actions. As narrator, Paul makes no bones about his dislike for aspects of his brother's personality and career, and it is clear that he nurses a swag of petty resentments, an adult version of sibling rivalry, which influences the way he and Claire respond to Serge. I soon got the message that Paul and Claire would not be willing parties to Serge's scheme to save his political bacon...The story continues to ramble around, with author Herman Koch bringing in all sorts of side-bars, which, frankly, drove me nuts! Why did I need to know this bumpf, when the big story was what to do about the sons and their crime? To Koch's credit as a skilled writer, all became clear in time, and much of the apparently irrelevant stuff became highly pertinent in the end.As Paul discloses more and more, it becomes clear that he is an unreliable narrator. His attitudes and behaviours, seemingly petty at first, begin to take on a more serious cast. To be honest, I thought The Dinner was going to be a straightforward morality story about the dilemma of parents who love their children and wish to protect them from the Law, versus the need to act with integrity and face the consequences of their actions. At one stage I asked myself out loud if Jodi Picoult had written a book along those lines - it is precisely the sort of story she excels at. But Koch takes us on a much more compelling and chilling adventure. I talked out loud to my sitting room quite a few times in the later parts of this book - 'OMG', 'No way', and similar exclamations kept popping out as the story unfolded in a way that I had not anticipated. As the real nature of Paul gradually emerged, I understood why he had indulged in such a lot of obfuscation at the start of the book. He was trying to explain and justify himself, his attitudes and actions, and he went off on tangents to avoid confronting uncomfortable truths. It made sense, though it did not endear the character to me. Furthermore it revealed aspects of his psychological make-up which were significant in the end.At the end, in the chapter ironically entitled 'Digestif', we learn of Paul's deep feelings for his wife Claire and son Michel, both of whose true natures are also revealed to us to some degree. The novel ends with us understanding just how close the family members are bonded by their shared love and commitment, though their lack of morality is truly chilling. Because this is not your typical morality tale, I did not finish The Dinner with a sense of satisfaction, that justice had been done and that society's norms had been vindicated. I think Koch has written a very clever story, in which every character is unlikeable to some degree. It makes for uneasy reading, and left me feeling very thoughtful about modern society and ethics. I would have given this book a higher star rating than 3 if the start had engaged me more positively. I'm glad I read it, but it was not a comfortable ride. </text></scrape>
