I did enjoy reading it, not a chore or a difficult read and I liked the chapter lengths and structure (for someone who finds it difficult to stay awake at night for more than a couple of pages, short chapters are great for me). I started out thinking that Paul as the key narrator of the story was an ok kind of bloke, certainly compared to his loathsome brother; but by the end, and despite the story behind his actions, I didn't like him at all. In fact, I'm not sure I liked any of the characters all that much. At the end of the book, I took a look at some of the quotes on the inside cover from various papers and magazines. "Funny" a couple of them stated. If there is one word to describe The Dinner that I wouldn't have picked, it's funny. The book is dark, it's sad, thought provoking and sinister, it's disturbing in many ways. But funny? I don't remember laughing!</text></scrape>
