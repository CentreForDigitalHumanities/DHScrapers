We all remember the kids with the amazing hovercraft at the science fair…the kids who couldn’t spell “physics” but happened to have engineer dads. We remember, too, the high school parties with parents present who didn’t mind that little 21 rule as long as no one broke any windows. It’s clear that the love we foster for our offspring is a drug so strong that side effects include legal and moral amnesia. Still, author Herman Koch illustrates new parental extremes. In The Dinner, Koch would have us believe that there is no protection, no lie, no sacrifice too extreme to compensate for the shortcomings and missteps of our little ones.Have you seen the famous film Dinner With Andre? The entire film takes place between friends over dinner. Full confession: I fell asleep for most of it, to the great chagrin of my friend, an uber-fan. There simply wasn’t enough plot for me to buy into the unusual construct. But imagine that you take that same construct – a conversation over dinner – and pepper in some ego and pretense, add a generous pinch of over-the-top drama, and douse it all in crime, mysteriousness, and stakes so high they will affect an entire nation. Now, chefs, you can nosh on the highly engaging and highly disturbing novel The Dinner.The book is structured like a menu; we move from drinks to appetizer to main course to dessert. It’s set in a chi chi restaurant, wildly expensive and serving anything but comfort food. In fact, nothing about this meal is comfortable. The dinner guests include Paul Lohman (our narrator), Serge Lohman (his brother), Claire Lohman (Paul’s wife) and Babette (Serge’s wife). erge, a slimy networker running for Prime Minister, and Babette, his emotional-wreck of an aging trophy wife, are the couple you love to hate. Paul and Claire, meanwhile, are the initial sweethearts of the novel – they seem sweet, in love, normal, and barely tolerant of the Hated Ones.At first, the clan talks of work, politics, and culture. They cover their mutual dislike with platitudes and passive aggressively use waiters as weapons. But soon, like the menu, the guests must get to the meat of the conversation. The Lohmans are meeting to discuss the fates of their boys – Michel, Paul and Claire’s athletic golden boy, Rick, Serge and Babette’s mealy angsty one, and Beau, their manipulative adoptee from Africa. The three have become inextricably mixed up in horrific crimes against innocent bystanders, and their parents must decide whether to stage a rescue or throw them to the courts. Meanwhile, we learn that at least half of the characters are clinically psychotic. Charming family, eh?This is a tale that will stress you out, tighten the muscles between your shoulder blades, and bend your mouth into a grimace. Most of all, The Dinner will bring on moral consternation as you decide for yourself what is right and what is wrong. I recommend reading this one with a friend so you can enjoy a spirited debate!Full review and inspired recipe here.</text></scrape>
