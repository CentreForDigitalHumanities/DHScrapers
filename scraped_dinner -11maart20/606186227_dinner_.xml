I just disliked all the characters so much that I don't want to like the book. Paul and Claire - I honestly believe that they are horrible individuals. Their values and beliefs clash so completely with mine that it was hard to swallow Paul's narration. And then you're supposed to dislike Serge and Babette, the snobby brother and sister-in-law ... Paul presents them in such an unforgiving light that you can't stand them either. Michel, Paul and Claire's son is very honestly a delinquent who is being taught that he can get away with treating people as second-class citizens. This book doesn't paint anyone in a very positive light ... and I imagine that is the point, allowing the reader to reflect more on "what we would do to protect our child". I didn't reflect on that, reading "The Dinner" simply tested my ability to finish a book who's characters I loathed.</text></scrape>
