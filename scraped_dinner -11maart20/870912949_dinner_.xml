How far would you go to protect them? This book is spectacular for it's building, arching story line. The characters evolve as you find out more of the back story, but they are all a bit pretentious and douche-y in their own individual ways. The details to the plot unfold as our four primary characters have dinner at a all natural, fine dinning establishment and that in itself lends a certain purposeful feeling to the whole plot. Extremely well written, thought-provoking, and an excellent basis for discussion with others. Nothing about this book is heart-warming or upbeat though; if you are currently in a funk yourself, this book will either give you a nudge further into the depths or make you realize you're not such a bad human after all - at least by comparison. </text></scrape>
