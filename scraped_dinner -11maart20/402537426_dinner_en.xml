I received it yesterday and consumed in great, torn-off hunks in every free moment. Unlike Gone Girl, which is something of a wild, fast ride that takes you exactly nowhere, The Dinner consigns you to its utterly brutal journey, partly due to its authorial elegance and the rising tide of complexities contained within.It is a book that begs to be re-read at least once, and discussed with others in person. Ideally, with readers who are enthusiastic to discuss it, regardless of whether they hated it or loved it. An ideal gathering would certainly include both, in my opinion. And, yes, a gathering over food. After all, why not?Perhaps I will have something of merit to add to this review at a later date, but in the meantime, I am speechless. Bravo, Mr. Koch.</text></scrape>
