I think it was the purpose for the reader to feel thrilled though? If it wasn't for this being a compulsory read for my Dutch class, I would've stopped wasting my time on it when I was halfway through the book. I heard such great things about it and I was so let down.Sure, the dilemma of 'How far should you go as a parent for your son/daughter who did something terribly wrong?' is a very important one, but the book itself was just quite boring to me. No thrills at all.1 star</text></scrape>
