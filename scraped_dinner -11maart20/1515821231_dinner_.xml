Story itself is divided in same way. Participants of this gathering, family one on first sight, are two couples, two Lohman brothers with their wives, one of them "big star" politician, future prime minister, the other one regular guy, teacher, ordinary sarcastic older brother. Or it all looked like that, at first sight.Although main plot is happening that evening, through their talking and events during that dinner, reader will get chance to know the characters through lots of flashbacks and events from past. As plot unfolds you will find out that main purpose of dinner is not family gathering but big secret which concerns all four of them, situation which needs to be solved because from it all of their future depends.Gathering begins with small talk but drama is unfolding minute by minute, with each dish brought on their table. What is excellent you really have feeling that you are sitting right next to four of them and you cannot help yourself listen, eavesdrop them.What gets little more oil to the fire is fact that dinner is taking place in expensive and hard-to-get-in restaurant with several months need-to-wait lists, the type of restaurant where it's not actually usual to have discussions at all, especially about such sensitive topics.In the end you will find out that nothing is like you think would be at first, you would start asking yourself what you would be doing put in situation like this and what is most important - family, ambition, future or image about ourselves...It must be admitted that in the end you will realize there are no "good-guys", but it is like that in the real world, as well.Dinner is a great read, something about you will think for sure alone and probably discuss over your own dinner...</text></scrape>
