I really didn't enjoy this book. There is nothing redeemable about any of the characters. They're all incredibly self-centered, self-serving, and narcissistic. Never mind the repeated statements by the main character of leaving out details of the story because "...it's nobody's business."

I finished it, but under internal protest. I'd already given up on two books this year and couldn't give myself an out on this one.</text></scrape>
