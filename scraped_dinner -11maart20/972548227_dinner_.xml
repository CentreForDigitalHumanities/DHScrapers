Framed by a fancy dinner out at a trendy urban Dutch restaurant, the story focuses on the protagonist's interactions with his wife, brother, and sister-in-law. Through the main character's inner-monologue and various flashbacks, we come to understand the true nature of the relationships at play during dinner, and nothing is at all what it seems. I had no idea the places this novel would go, so I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet read it, but aspects of it are both hilarious and unsettling, and the Koch calls into question how strong the bonds of family really are, especially in the face of our sense of civil duty and responsibility.</text></scrape>
