None of the characters are likeable or relatable--they don't have to be, but in this case they weren't even interesting either. The book is basically built on descriptions of things that don't matter whatsoever. The crime the whole thing is about didn't shock me, and the ending was such an anticlimax. Would not recommend.</text></scrape>
