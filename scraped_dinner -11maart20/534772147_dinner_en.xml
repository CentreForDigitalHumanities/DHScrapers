Two couples meet to discuss what is to be done about their children, boys who have been involved in a horrifying and highly publicized crime. Cleverly plotted; the narrator reveals just enough with each course to build tension and keep you guessing. Ultimately, a disturbing tale about disturbing people, but I couldn't help appreciating the narrator's perspective on fine dining. A little bit of dark humor in a dark book.About small portions:"The first thing that struck you about Claire's plate was its vast emptiness...it was as though the empty plate was challenging you to say something about it, to go to the kitchen and demand an explanation. 'You wouldn't even dare!' the plate said, and laughed in your face."About the waiter's errant pinky:"I wasn't sure I would be able to sit still when that hand, with its pinky, was floating over my own plate, but for the sake of a pleasant evening I knew it would be better to restrain myself...I would act as though there were nothing strange at all about the hand if a perfect stranger waving over the food on my plate."About the waiter's annoying habit of describing the food:"'This is warm goat's cheese with pine nuts and walnut shavings.' The hand with the pinky was above my own plate now. I fought back the urge to say 'I know, because that's what I ordered,' and concentrated on the pinky.The book has been compared to Gone Girl, and while it has some similarities - mainly an unreliable narrator and a cast of unlikeable characters - I felt the questions at the heart of the novel mirrored those in Defending Jacob: how well do you really know your child? How far will you go to protect him? Do genetics play a role in the tendency towards violence? What is the parent's responsibility in defining morality?Overall, a compelling story that raises serious questions. It doesn't have quite the same one-two punch of Defending Jacob, but it would be a great selection for book club. Might make you lose your appetite, though. ;) </text></scrape>
