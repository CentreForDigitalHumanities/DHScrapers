Delicious and twisted, I feel so dirty sympathising with such a revolting character until I got to halfway... I sensed myself squirming as the plot unravels I could literally feel the restaurant walls closing in...compelling to say the least. The ethical and moral dilemma posed in this book really got the brain ticking so I guess that's a good thing going for this book, I did enjoy it even though I had a hard time getting to grips with such a sociopathic character.</text></scrape>
