Sadly this book was one of them, i felt like the book was a bunch of nonsense and every time i thought we where getting somewhere to what the book was about, right back to nonsense. i had no idea what the main character was talking about half the time. the characters felt distant from each other, and just not very likeable. </text></scrape>
