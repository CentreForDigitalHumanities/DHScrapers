First, the translation from the Dutch was excellent. Second, Koch's voice, of an unpleasant man, sick of pretension, is crystal clear. As in the book Summer House with Swimming Pool the characters are well drawn but to a man or woman, one and all, despicable, self absorbed, completely amoral, without conscience and not bothered by that at all. The plot device, 2 couples discuss their troubled teens over an elegant dinner really works. The end is very upsetting. I can't figure out if Koch is a sociopath or just a great writer. Perhaps he is both. An excellent book.</text></scrape>
