It's written alright enough to keep you interested into what suspense is next. However it never delivers. The shocking part of it is downright screwed up. Thinking this is the major plot point to bring the 2 couples together. Horrible people make horrible kids. That's a good premise for a novel? All assholes. Each character. I kept reading because it was a simple read to hope something actually interesting came along and no it did not. Fuck, at least Gone Girl had some ballsy plot points. Stop saying this is European Gone Girl. Quite honestly this book doesn't deserve the hype it's somehow created. </text></scrape>
