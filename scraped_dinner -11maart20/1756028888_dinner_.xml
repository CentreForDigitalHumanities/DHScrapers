Paul and his wife, Claire, are meeting his brother Serge and his wife, Babette for dinner. Apparently, they need to discuss something important.What starts off as a dinner with some undisclosed tension between the families rapidly descends into a tale of deceit, horror, and crimes too gruesome to imagine. The author weaves the story cleverly interspersing the gruesome parts with subtle humour, lovely descriptions of food, and other banalities.None of the characters are particularly likeable, but they're written well. And of course, when the story is being narrated by an unreliable narrator, what could be better?Think 'Gone Girl' and think 'We need to talk about Kevin' and then think of something way more twisted than these. That's what this book is all about.</text></scrape>
