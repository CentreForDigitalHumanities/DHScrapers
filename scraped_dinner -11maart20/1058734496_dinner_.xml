It probably deserves a bit more than four stars but that's all it's going to get. To start out with, this WOULD be a good book for all the Gone Girl fans out there. It has the mystery, the twist, the shocking dialogue and conclusion. Just not as much as Gone Girl. For those of you happening to read this review in 2020, Gone Girl is what every psychological thriller is compared to in 2014. The Dinner started off very strong. The internal dialogue was especially interesting. The honest and brutal descriptions of everyday people, places, and things is something rarely seen in books and conversation and why, no doubt, has the Gillian Flynn references flying about. A note on the book. Alot of people were saying that(not to give anything away here) one of the characters was a sociopath, and it was a type of character study on the sociopath. I kind of take issue with that description because I don't think it really fits this guy. I think alot of people are still caught up in the whole Amy Dunn syndrome and have to throw everyone that's in the crazy boat in with her. I think personally that this character had ALOT of feelings and made them known all the time, especially in the last half of the book and the last couple pages. I think the sociopath diagnosis is way off. Psychopath rather.....yeah, they could definitely swing THAT label!! But again, this isn't one of those stereotypical, "oh, i'm in a mental ward and I'm so misunderstood, and I wear a white gown and take medication all day, and only one doctor believes that I'm really not that crazy" type of books. It is like what would happen if the mental ward patient could function in the real world and what they would say and do. There is SOOOOOOO much more than just that aspect of the story though. There is the entire nature vs. nurture conversation. There is the 'how far would you go to protect your children' argument. There is the relationship between adoptive kids and their parents and biological kids and their parents, as well as the relationship and the bond, or the lack of bond between siblings. There is again, the entire internal conversation and storytelling that the main character has with the reader. Which leads me straight into the writing. It was very good prose. Approachable and extremely appropriate and well done for this type of book. The slow progression into the character gets deeper and deeper. The main reservation I DO have about the writing is that towards the end, there is a bit much left to the imagination. In the interview in the back of the book, the author says he does this on purpose, but I didn't find this type of book to be the kind that leaves a whole bunch of questions lingering. You expect the book to wrap things up in your mind and if not satisfying, at least bringing some things to a better understanding in your mind or at least wrap it up. That's really the only reason the book gets 4 stars instead of 5. If the last 1/4 of the book would have been like the first 3/4, it would have gotten an easy 5 stars from me. And that first half of the book is quite enjoyable with some very memorable paragraphs from the main character. Definitely give it a go, and quite possibly you will find a bit more in the end than I did. (Also, it's the best Dutch book I have ever read.)</text></scrape>
