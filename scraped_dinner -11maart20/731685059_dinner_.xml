I think that's the most flattering thing I can say about it. I read it fast, I wanted to know what it was building toward, and then I was left feeling...bleh.I must give credit for the decent writing and, as mentioned, ability to keep my interest vaguely piqued. But the premise is completely unconvincing. The characters are entirely dislikable, but that is neither here nor there. I've enjoyed unlikable, unreliable narrators a great deal (hi Humbert! (-:). This one just wasn't very interesting.I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. I can only point to what I'll call the 'Gone Girl' effect. That was a better book. </text></scrape>
