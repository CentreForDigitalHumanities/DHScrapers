Or no, not regret. You say something so razor-sharp that the person you say it to carries it around with them for the rest of their life. I thought about her cheerful face. When I said to her what I said, it broke down the middle. Like a vase. Or like a glass that shatters at a high-pitched note.” The Dinner is a novel by the Dutch author Herman Koch. It was translated into English. Two couples meet at a fancy restaurant in Amsterdam for dinner. The gentle, polite conversation that follows is full of forced smiles and empty words about everyday, mundane things. The chapters are creatively split into Aperitif, Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert and Digestif. With each main course, knives are being sharpened and civility takes a backseat, especially as the conversation revolves around their children. Pros: This book is well-suited to fall under the genre of Contemporary, Humor, Subtle mystery/Psychological thriller. The story starts off with tongue-in-the-cheek and even laugh-out-loud sarcasm which TOTALLY appealed to my evil sense of humor! LOL. The plain ridiculousness of fancy, elite life is expressed so well! The most horrific thing about the story was the subtle yet dark transitioning from sarcastic humor to psychological creepiness. I was grinning throughout the chapters and suddenly I realized the grin had faded and been wiped off my face! You will feel enveloped with a dark sense of evil, specially when you realize that’s exactly how people are in real life too. You never know who you are dealing with until you see their true colors. The story is from an unreliable narrator, full of unreliable flashbacks. The chapters are short and focused. It’s not a thriller full of adrenaline, it is quite subtle. But it will keep you hooked onto the story and make you flip the pages real fast. Didn’t feel like a translation. Very well-written, twisted story. The ending is downright creepy. For some reason, I kept thinking of scenes from Gone Girl when reading it. Cons: None really. The ending and everything else in the story is totally open-ended and up for the readers’ interpretations – something that I like. So if you don’t like to work your grey cells in figuring out a story and what happened, this book is not for you.  </text></scrape>
