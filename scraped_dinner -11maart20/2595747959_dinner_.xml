Perhaps it was the translation to English I read. The descriptions of the dining experience are spot on. You don't need the DSM to see more than one character is a sociopath. but...why choose a well known dining place to discuss a family matter? Unless they wanted to be in public and lessen the chance of a scene. Some of the situations change tense and location. Unless the narrator is thinking to himself and the events do not really happen. The Syndrome /Spectrum is made up the author, certainly.</text></scrape>
