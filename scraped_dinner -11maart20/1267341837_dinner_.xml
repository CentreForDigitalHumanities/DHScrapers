The Good:
- An interesting/different novel
- Read in 1 day over 2 sittings, couldn't put it down
- Liked the concept and layout
- Liked how things (and people) weren't how they appeared to be

The Bad:
- The characters!!
- The storyline
- The ending
- The characters!

4 vs. 4- I'm rating this one right down the middle, 3 stars.</text></scrape>
