Two days later I'm still thinking about the ending. I wish I had read it for bookclub because man, this book needs some serious discussion!The first third of the book sets you up one way and then out of nowhere the whole thing shifts. I immediately started reevaluating my thoughts on the narrator and the other characters and as the evening unfolding I kept having to adjust my assessments. I can't say more without giving away major spoilers but damn. Totally worth a read especially for fans of gone girl and girl on the train.</text></scrape>
