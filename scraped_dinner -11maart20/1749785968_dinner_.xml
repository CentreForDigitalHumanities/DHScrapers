"American Psycho" comes to mind, which is narrated by a mass-murderer. I enjoy"A Clockwork Orange," though the book is much better than the movie... and its narrated by a spoiled, unrepentant teenage thug. And I love to hate "The Great Gatsby"'s pompous, unreliable narrator Nick Caraway. "The Dinner" by Herman Koch is cut from the same cloth. The narrator Paul is unlikable. I don't want to give away too much -- there are plenty of older reviews that go into details -- but the narrator is Paul, an unemployed history teacher. Who is struggling with a moral dilemma that could impact his son and nephew's futures. So he and his wife Claire meet his brother Serge and his sister-in-law Babette, parents of the nephew n question, to discuss the situation. The meeting takes place in a posh restaurant, which irritates Paul. It's one of those upscale place, and the over-solicitous wait staff stops to explain everything. Like,. for instance, where and how the grapes were grown. But as the night goes on, and Paul flashes back, he becomes more and more unhinged. And his annoyance borders on rage... a rage that seems a disproportionate reaction to the stimuli that "set him off" with increasing regularity. And then, we learn that Paul suffers from an unnamed defect named after an unspecified Austrian doctor. Worse, he's not taken his medication that evening. And thus, we have a setup. I read the book allegorically. So a lot of what would make the plot preposterous -- why, for instance, would you choose a fine-dining restaurant with hovering staff to hold a private family discussion about the future of your family? A place where you'll likely be overheard. Or how no one besides Paul and Claire noticed that a popular video running on the national news features their son and nephew -- two popular, local high school students who had just left a party befoer the video was shot. Just too much did not add up, or seemed convenient. Sort of like "A Clockwork Orange," but much less artfully managed, it seemed to me. Since Burgess' classic still pulls me in, even though I've read it multiple times, while "The Dinner" simply felt staged. That said, the allegory Koch seems to be arguing lays bare how our ids -- our raw emotionality -- is often at odds with how we need to comport ourselves. And while Paul's affliction -- if he has one, since there is no guarantee with first-person narrators, since they can be unreliable -- makes it harder for him to mask his unacceptable bits, he still manages to do so most of the time. I especially enjoyed how Koch contrasted the angry, impulsive Paul to his highly-successful brother Serge. Both love the children they are at the dinner to discuss. And yet Paul, while aware of how important decorum and concern for others is, tends to act without concern or decorum. While Serge, who has infinitely more to lose than Paul, can be at once instinctive and supportive of the social order. Paul sneers, and sees this as Serge being phony. And yet, he is such a flawed narrator, his judgments hold little credence. Since it appears as if Serge has both empathy for others and a moral compass. Things which Paul often lacks. All things told, I enjoyed the book on one level. Since we've all been faced with things that threaten our equanimity. And lash out, like Paul, to protect our self-image. Lucky for all of us, though, we don't bash people on the head with pots. Nor do we fantasize squashing the skull of our children's teachers or our own bosses. But we all do fight. And we all lash out defensively. By the way, I have heard this referred to as a European "Gone Girl." Though there are similarities -- some disgusting people doing disgusting things to each other, decent, innocent bystanders be damned -- I find that "The Dinner" owes more to Camus and Wilde, and thus seems more substantial. Like an 18th Century comedy of morals... albeit with an Agatha Christie twist. While "Gone Girl" seems to ape Hitchcock and topical satire, a book of its time with little resonance backwards in time. Either way, I liked this book a little more than I liked "Gone Girl," which I disliked. Worse, I had the book's major twist figured out so much in advance that much of the charm others found in the book, which is based on the sudden "gotcha" which causes the pieces to fall into place, was lost on me. Three stars. </text></scrape>
