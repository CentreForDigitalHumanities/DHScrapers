The depth of exploration of its themes (parenthood, family, love, accountability, etc.) could be adequately displayed in a synopsis — which is kind of what it felt like: a 292-page-long synopsis of a better novel. The ending is very unsatisfactory, as well. Considering how many pages are used on unimportant details, an adequate ending would’ve made the book much stronger overall. Instead, it takes fewer than ten pages to wrap up 280 pages of set-up. Nevertheless, I did enjoy reading it. I’d classify it as a good beach read, because you’re sure not going to want to write a paper about it.</text></scrape>
