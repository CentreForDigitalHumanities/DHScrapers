It reminded me greatly of Lionel Shriver's We need to talk about Kevin with chilling reflection on nature or nurture. It was well constructed rather than contrived. I love Koch's approach of the first two sentences setting the DNA of the novels and that they are the central reference point. The families themselves are highly unique and we could talk about that for a long time, but, at the end of the day people do mad and outrageous things every day in to world, families are broken and re broken and what constitutes a family now is so variable. If you like dark and quirky then this is definitely worth tracking down.</text></scrape>
