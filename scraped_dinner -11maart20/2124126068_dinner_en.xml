Personally, I’m a huge fan of this narrative element. With only one setting featured, books (and movies) within this category naturally focus on character. Psychological machinations are revealed & moral complexities explored. It can be a very effective plot device, but one that’s potentially unappealing to the masses. Despite my love for this trope, I always have a difficult time rating these works. Did I enjoy The Dinner? Yes. Will most readers? Probably not. And given that disparity, I hesitate to make a broad recommendation for the work.  It’s a very specific story with a very specific audience.Marketing promoted The Dinner as a european Gone Girl. Clearly an attempt for mass appeal. But it’s a deceptive strategy. The Dinner is only similar to Gone Girl in the most general sense. Those expecting a quickly paced, overtly chilling story are primed for disappointment. The Dinner is a slower moving, considerate piece reliant on reader attention. As the title indicates, the entirety of the book is based around a dinner. Two couples, brothers accompanied by their spouses, meet at a swanky Amsterdam restaurant to discuss a horrific event perpetrated by their children. Basically a “what should we do about the kids” situation. The story is divided into sections, each named for a different meal course. Paul, one of the two brothers, is our guide to this progressively deteriorating affair. And Paul’s first-person narration is both the book’s genius and its failure. The Dinner relies on the assumption that first-person narration naturally endears readers to the lead character. Being witness to a narrator’s inner-most thoughts increases the likelihood that we’ll accept his or her perceptions as fact. In The Dinner, our experience is entirely filtered through Paul. Paul’s obvious disdain for his politician brother, Serge is established early. Serge never reserves a table three months in advance. Serge makes the reservation on the day itself--he says he thinks of it as a sport. You have restaurants that reserve a table for people like Serge Lohman, and this restaurant happens to be one of them…..It makes you wonder whether there isn’t one restaurant in the whole country where they don’t faint right away when they hear the name Serge Lohman on the phone. He doesn’t make the call himself, of course; he lets his secretary or one of his assistants do that.Paul’s cynical, misanthropic outlook on life and evident contempt for the restaurant’s pretentious trappings is darkly humorous. Couple that with Paul’s respect and admiration for his wife, Claire, and it becomes easy to assume his viewpoint. He’s a middle-class, former teacher with a seemingly blissful, yet ordinary homelife. Paul’s no slick-talking, superficially charming politician like his brother. Uh-uh. Paul’s an introspective, educated guy rightfully skewering the upper class. He’s a man of the people. And it’s that early appeal that lulls readers into a purposely false sense of security. We believe Serge is inauthentic and boorish, that Paul and Claire are the story’s moral compass, because we trust Paul. We assume his opinions are accurate and just. And it’s in this manipulation that the tale’s brilliance lies.HOWEVER, the novel’s genius is simultaneously its undoing. We spend so much time in Paul’s head that readers may drown in his nonsensical ramblings. The dinner, and interactions with Serge and his sister-in-law Babette, is not a-thrill-a-minute. The narrative focuses far more on Paul, his backstory, and various opinions. Like one long soliloquy. And when I say long, I mean LONG. What happens and is said at dinner is sparse compared to Paul’s repeated tangents. I enjoy extensive character introspection, many readers do not. In fact, about 100 pages in, I predict most readers will say WHY IS NOTHING HAPPENING??? I’M SO BORED. The Dinner is composed of measured revelations. Breadcrumbs purposely planted. But it takes a WHILE before those breadcrumbs take shape. Early on the dinner’s mainly occupied with the kind of artificial small talk we share with acquaintances. Recent holidays, movies enjoyed, career updates...BLAH, BLAH. BLAH. Slowly the polite veneer wears off and true personalities emerge. Slowly being the operative word. Readers have to be patient. Really, really patient. You have to to enjoy, or at least tolerate aimless musing. And inconsequential rambling is not a quality many readers are looking for in a book. They’re there to be entertained, so want SOMETHING….ANYTHING to happen. And justifiably so. I get it. So if that’s you, The Dinner ain’t your kinda book. At its core this is a story about the impact of violence on a family. The rippling effects. And the lengths parents are willing to go to protect their children. It’s an interesting topic relatable to many people. The ending, though, sadly shies away from any meaningful statement. The story’s darkness unfulfilled. The plot goes one way, then bails at the last minute. Wimps out. The conclusion is just too tidy. And darkness & tidiness are not suitable companions. </text></scrape>
