Everyone in the book and all those that are discussing the characters'actions without disgust need to be institutionalised! The translation makes for clumsy and simplistic reading, the repetition is tedious, but above all, the fact that nowhere does anyone say 'this is ridiculous' is more than disturbing. It's a hateful, silly story about hateful, silly people and I only continued reading it because I was too lazy to get out of bed to get another book. The quasi-secretive, secretive ending got me up though! All those hours I'll never get back - wasted!!!! I had to get on here and see what others thought and was astounded to find all the good reviews. Perhaps everyone is Dutch or German? It left this English reader cold. </text></scrape>
