I loved the idea of this book, an entire novel written about a single dinner between two couples. Unfortunately the book fell flat for me. I didn't enjoy the side stories, nor warm to any of the characters. Dark and twisted, yes. But thrilling? No. I read to the end waiting for a twist that never eventuated.</text></scrape>
