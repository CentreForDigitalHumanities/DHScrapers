And it was on a NY Times list (or some list) for must read books! It was awful! The characters were awful!! Not Gone Girl love to hate kind of awful but simply awful - self centered, narcissistic don't give a crap about anyone but their own son (not really even each other because it appears they deceive each other throughout their lives as well). Their son who is, of course, equally AWFUL!!! And the plot rolls out (pun intended) over what seems to be a very long, posh dinner amongst two couples (brothers who hate each other and their bizarre wives) where they decide the fate of their horrible kids. There is backstory blended in between courses where we get bits and pieces of their family history, but the author purposefully leaves out details that would help the reader understand a little of the cause of the madness. Sigh. OMG- save yourselves! If your curiosity compels you to read this ludicrous book, at least borrow from a friend or your library!!! Whew- rant over.....</text></scrape>
