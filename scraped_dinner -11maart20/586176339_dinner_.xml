While I understand this book has become an international bestseller, for me it doesn't hold together because its dirty deeds are attributed to some sort of unexplained neurological problem. I enjoyed the way the story was structured. Having the narrator be so unreliable was no problem. But the explanation for the events of the story just doesn't make sense. The violence that occurs in this novel is just too public to be ignored the way that it is in the story. Plus I think there are more sociopaths in literature than there are in real life.</text></scrape>
