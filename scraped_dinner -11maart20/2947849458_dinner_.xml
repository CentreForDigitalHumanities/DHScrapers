How far are these parents willing to go to protect their kids?As a parent I worry whether my kids will be bullied or harassed and how they and I as their parent will deal with it. This book was thought provoking for me as it showed me the other side of the fence. What if instead my kids were the bullies. What a scary thought. What would happen then? How deeply do our actions, mannerisms and projected thoughts influence our children. What lengths would we as parents go to protect our kids - would we hide the wrongdoings, would we explain it away.The narrator of this book Paul Lohman is not a nice character. In fact, all the characters of this book are extremely hard to relate to. Everything is shown to us from the skewed perspective of Paul. Some of his observations and opinions, especially about the uber-exclusive restaurant where they eat and the meals are quite fun, and the overall narrative is filled with metaphors and descriptions that are a treat to read. There are also some bits here and there about certain mannerisms that are supposedly a very "Dutch thing" to do, and a bit of commentary on how things are in Holland - which was quite interesting. The writing style is quite nice.What didn't work for me was the slightly disjointed narrative of the main character Paul. Lot of sudden jumping from flashbacks to present and back- which was a bit confusing for me. I guess given Paul's personality and mental health situation it can be accepted, but I was looking forward to way more conversation between the characters than the lot of internal thoughts of Paul - which was the majority of the book.It is a disturbing perspective which we are given - the amount of dehumanization of certain types of people that takes place to justify the actions of the characters, how badly flawed they are and what lengths they go to to justify it to themselves and protect their son. It's difficult to relate to or root for anyone in this book, so I didn't really get sucked into the story, or emotions of the characters.Overall since the writing style was so engaging and vivid, despite the disconnect with the characters, this book is a decent read.</text></scrape>
