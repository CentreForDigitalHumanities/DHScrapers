I needed a real page turner to get me out, and this book definitely delivered.It was fast and engaging; I read it in 2 days. Some people have compared it to Gone Girl, I guess since it's suspenseful and disturbing haha. But the thing I liked the most about it was the set up of telling the whole story over the course of a dinner. I loved that format. It felt like a play to me, and I'm excited to see the movie with Laura Linney (who I'm totally obsessed with). If you get bored of the same setting or lack of action, you might not enjoy this one. But if you enjoy subtle psychological thrills, dive in!!</text></scrape>
