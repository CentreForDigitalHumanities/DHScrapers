It alerted me to some of what I was to find.... a book full of dislikable people, swift changes of perspective, a clever book, one designed perhaps for book groups to discuss (and yes, at the end I found one of those wearisome lists of suggested questions), clickbait almost (in some ways it was a Dutch 'The Slap' although a better book than that).I enjoyed reading a Dutch work... it added to the slight jarring sensation, not being my own culture, not being US culture and it might be interesting to ponder the actions of the main characters in the light of their justice system (there's a too brief reference to the consequences if justice takes its course). However, an awareness that the far right is at work in Holland makes the book seem less neutral. The framework of a posh restaurant dinner was initially appealing, entertaining to be privy to Paul's many micro annoyances, but ultimately ludicrous (unless Serge was anxious to avoid having the discussion in private where there was access to pans...)Taken as something of a 'sibling rivalry gone nuclear' this works, but instead there's a whole 'genetic disorder detectable via amniocentesis and treatable with medication' strand which is very weird. It seems that, in a very details based book, Koch has made this up himself for a convenient discussion point twist. I tried to go along with it but it was too important to the story to be quite so unrealistic.The Beau/Faso strand was interesting but none of the boys really came through as real individuals and there's one other child, the twin daughter, who is mentioned but then left out of the story and that feels odd. I don't recall any significant reference to Serge and Paul's background... nor indeed Claire's and that is perhaps more relevant than it might seem. So that feels odd too. As does the apparent lack of consequences for the past incidents which are slowly revealed as part of the picture.</text></scrape>
