It was such an interesting story, that would be hard to forget. The injustice, the twists, the writing style, I liked it all. it kept me so interested that I wanted to know how it ends. The ending might not be the ideal for many people, including myself, but I think the author wanted to show that sometimes the justice never happens. It was quite sad. It is hard to write a review without spoiling anything, so I just want to say if you end up reading this, it will piss you off and will be stuck in your brain. there are two kinds of pissing off books: books that just are awful and the books that are good, but the storyline's characters are shitty people. I think this books contains interesting discussion points.Definitely recommending!</text></scrape>
