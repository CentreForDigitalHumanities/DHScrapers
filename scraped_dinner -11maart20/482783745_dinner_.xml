I found myself skimming passages. While the main part of the story takes place in the restaurant, we do get a pretty good idea of events leading up to the dinner through the narration of Paul. I found this book incredibly disturbing and sick. I hated all of the characters. None of them seem to have a conscience. I was also annoyed by the omission of certain details. Such as the name of the condition that Paul was supposed to be afflicted with that made him violent. Why not just say it? I really dislike having to read between the lines. The ending was puzzling and left me looking for more.</text></scrape>
