I was expecting more of a "moral dilemma" book....but that's not what this was. And I don't want to say anything else to spoil it. Just know that I was sucked into the book by about page 50 and had to finish it as quickly as possible. I wanted to know what was really going on but I also wanted to be far away from these people.</text></scrape>
