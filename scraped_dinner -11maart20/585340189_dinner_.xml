There are twists to the story, I suppose, they're just not the kind of twists to leave you breathless, with your heart pounding madly and questions running through your head. They're not obvious twists, neither are they ones I could have never guessed were coming, they just sort of confirmed what I already suspected about the characters and their motivations.The characters are three-dimensional, though most aren't likable, nor could I identify with them, seeing as how they had some issues I fortunately haven't experienced and hope I never will. Read: they were all effing insane.All in all, The Dinner has a very different literary style, at least for someone who's acquainted to American/British/Australian styles, it seemed to me that it wasn't sure whether it wanted to be a thriller, a comedy or a drama, and thus ended up being none of the above. And despite not wowing me as it apparently has wowed lots of other people, there was still some entertainment to get off of it.</text></scrape>
