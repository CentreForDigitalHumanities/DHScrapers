Then I ran into this one and its fresh recommendation and figured I might as well take a peek. Read a few chapters in the library while Lucas was looking at books. Read through the first half while Lucas was playing at the playground. Read another quarter on the couch in the evening and just finished up this morning. This book definitely had me turning pages and its the first book I've read in Dutch since... high school? So that's saying a lot. Its hard to say much more about the book without giving anything away, this is one you just need to read and see for yourself. I might give a rating more towards 3.5 if that was possible, but having finished this book in less than 24 hours it definitely deserves the bump to four stars.</text></scrape>
