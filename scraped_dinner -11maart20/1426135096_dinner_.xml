The author jumped around a lot and I just feel there wasn't a lot of sense or meaning to the story line. The characters were all either sneaky, conniving, downright mean and nasty. There wasn't one character I liked. I really feel that the author was not in a happy place when writing this book because it was just negative all the way through. The only parts I enjoyed were some of the descriptions of the food. It was definitely not a page turner for me but I did want to see how it ended so I continued on. Truthfully I just didn't get it!!!</text></scrape>
