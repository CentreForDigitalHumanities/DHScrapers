It ended up being a lot more complex than I initially thought and I have so many questions. What starts out as an uncomfortable dinner between two brothers and their wives evolves into something dark and sinister. I'm anxious to see this story played out on the big screen!I had a hard time rating this book because even though I thought it was well-written, I didn't like any of the characters and I was bored with the storyline until about halfway through because I didn't know where the story was going. That said, I'm glad I read it, but I can't exactly say that I enjoyed it.</text></scrape>
