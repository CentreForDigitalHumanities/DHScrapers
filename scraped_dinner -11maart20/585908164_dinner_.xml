Maybe I was expecting too much as it was compared to Defending Jacob, which I really liked but I don't feel this book measures up.Mainly I feel it was too slow moving, it took a third of the book before we found out what the sons did and another third before the parents actually started discussing it at the dinner. I felt there was too much about the main character's past, I don't believe all of it was relevant to the story.The book obviously raises a lot of moral questions about what people would do for their children and what these parents were prepared to do was shocking and thought provoking but besides those interesting elements, this book wasn't for me.</text></scrape>
