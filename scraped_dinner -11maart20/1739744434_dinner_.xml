Of course, I immediately wanted to know what crime they had committed. When I eventually sat down to read the book, I could not put it down. The fathers of the two boys are the narrator, Paul and his brother Serge, a well-known politician. Paul is very critical of his brother and despises the type of restaurant his brother has chosen as the venue for the evening's discussion. The beginning of the book is therefore very, very entertaining with Paul's caustic inner monologue which is essentially a takedown of a pompous, frighteningly expensive, farm-to-table type of locale. Equally entertaining are Paul's reflections on the Dutch vacationing in France where his brother has a second home. However, as the evening progresses, Paul's narration becomes darker and more twisted as the crime the boys have committed (which remains unsolved by the cops, although all four parents know by now that their sons were involved) is revealed, as are the very different attitudes of each parent as to what should be done.SPOILER ALERT: The crime is extremely disturbing, and although I have already denoted this as a spoiler alert, I am not actually revealing the entire sordid extent of the crime in saying that the boys have committed murder, at best manslaughter, of a homeless woman. Many of the reviews I have read of this book describe Paul as an unreliable narrator. I disagree. He is a dislikeable, nasty piece of work who apparently flies into rages (partly explained by a genetic disorder which is never actually identified) but he does not seem unreliable to me. On the contrary, he appears totally honest about his reactions and his past. It is his attitude towards certain classes of society and his view that it is sometimes all right to take the law into one's own hands that is disgusting. It is also a pointer to why his son may have committed the crime he did. But more disgusting is the boy's mother who is adamant that they should all cover up this crime.She is the surprise of the book. Portrayed as an intelligent woman she argues vehemently to keep the boys protected from any consequences. While I can understand any mother's desire to protect a son, in this case I felt it was too incredible. The crime after all involved the taking of another life, and if nothing else she had to have questioned her son's mental health to commit such a crime and not suffer any guilt or recriminations. </text></scrape>
