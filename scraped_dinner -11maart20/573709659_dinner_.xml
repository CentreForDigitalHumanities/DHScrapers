I was initially intrigued by the caustic voice of Paul but the discovery that he is an unreliable narrator early on was the only punch that Koch landed, in my opinion. The schematic plot felt forced, the actions of the characters implausible and the themes borrowed. At least Yasmina Reza's 'God of Carnage' was intended as farce. Watch Michael Haneke's film 'Cach√©' instead.</text></scrape>
