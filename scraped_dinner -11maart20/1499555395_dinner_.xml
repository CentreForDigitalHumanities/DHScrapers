I can't tell you the name of the man who wrote the book because perhaps he doesn't want his name mentioned in this review of this unnamed book. I read it while eating food that could have come from the restaurant for ordinary people, as opposed to the restaurant for extraordinary people. And that's how it goes--on and on. People beat the crap out of other people, but no one knows, no one cares. Some of the mediocrity of the book can be laid at the door of the translator, but the majority of it falls smack dab bang onto the head of the author. Silly book. Silly characters. Silly execution.</text></scrape>
