One pair is a famous politician, shoe-in for prime minister, and his wife Babette. The other is our narrator, the politican's brother Paul and his wife Claire. Koch uses the courses of the meal as structure for the unfolding story. The scenes in the restaurant are told in excruciating detail; the rest is told in Paul's flashbacks.Gillian Flynn aptly describes the book as "chilling, nasty, smart, shocking and unputdownable." Others have described it as "dark and twisted."Our narrator Paul is strikingly, refreshingly honest and blunt (which is apparently a Dutch trait); he is unapologetically sarcastic and brutally judgmental of everyone outside his immediate family, including even the reader himself, telling us when something is none of our business. He's an avid observer of human behavior, ridiculing the overt pretentiousness of the overpriced meal. However, the deeper down the rabbit hole the story goes, the clearer it becomes that Paul is the classic unreliable narrator. Koch forces the reader to question what is true and what is false. Paul is fiercely and pathologically and violently dedicated to his family; there is basically nothing he wouldn't do to protect them. The Netherlands is a very stable and progressive country; they are often ranked as one of the world's most prosperous countries with the highest levels of public safety and human development; setting this story in this safe place is clearly a satiric take on the dark corners of the human psyche; even the bourgeois are capable of horrible violence.**spoiler alert**The two couples each have a fifteen year old son. They have done something horrible, and the police are investigating. Both sets of parents know what happened. Paul violently dislikes his brother; he spends a majority of the novel picking him apart, and yet it is Serge who wants to "do the right thing" - he wants to withdraw from the race for prime minister to protect his son (and himself); he wants to go to the police with what they know. The other three are against this; Babette wants him to continue to run for PM; Claire and Paul don't want to destroy Michel's life.I missed the Asperger's reference/hint so I was less annoyed than some readers regarding the miss-characterization of symptoms but I was frustrated by the pat explanation for his behavior, and, by extension, Michel's. Verbally brutal in the classroom = seeing a psychologist? Psychologist within 30m diagnoses a mental disorder? Based on what?? I think the book would have been more powerful if we were left questioning Paul's mental state. If something was wrong w/ Paul that was genetically transferred to Michel in some modern version of "the sins of the father" would that make Paul more culpable in what Michel has become? Michel did see Paul commit acts of violence at a young age, in effect justifying violence. So for Claire to be the one to continue the cycle of violence...who knew she was capable of it??</text></scrape>
