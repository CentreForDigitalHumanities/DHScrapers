Over the course of an evening, through dinner conversation and a series of flashbacks we discover the shocking events that have brought the two couples together and the even more disturbing lengths one pair will go to to protect their only child. Far darker than the cover would imply; a veneer or civility hides deep contempt here, but only just. Brilliant flashes of humour raise this book above the ordinary. A must read book.</text></scrape>
