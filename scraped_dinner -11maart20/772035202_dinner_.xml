It is "Chilling, nasty, smart, shocking, and unputdownable." And, once again, I am baffled by the low ratings here on Goodreads. I raced through this book and even though this book has been called the European "Gone Girl", I think this is the better book (sorry, Gillian Flynn). "The Dinner" isn't nearly as contrived or overly long and, although I did enjoy reading it, "Gone Girl" is both. I see this book as more like Lionel Shriver's "We Need to Talk About Kevin" and it is an enjoyable read in the mystery/thriller/ messed-up family genre. There are some spectacularly amoral characters in this book who masquerade as loving, normal parents. Some reviewers have described this book as being about the lengths parents will go to in order to protect their children from their wrong-doings. I saw it more as the genetic inheritance of the evil gene and the complete absence of a moral compass in people who are raising children. </text></scrape>
