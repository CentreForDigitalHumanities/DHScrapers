I don't care how much you hate your brother. I don't care about what you're eating (and I love food! but these descriptions are void of any substance). I don't care about the waiter's dumb pinky finger. I don't care about your pissing habits. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care.
I usually see a book through once I've started, but I just can't. After 88 pages, I created a special DNF shelf just for you, The Dinner. Don't get too lonely up there.</text></scrape>
