Soon enough, you realise you're dining with extremely unlikeable characters, and the bite comes — starting with an apertif and through to the digestif — with the knowledge of being in company of an unreliable narrator. The evening unfolds in a tale that concerns and confronts many an affliction of the middle-class bourgeoisie:  The Dinner  presents a delectably dark palate spanning mental illness; heredity; dehumanization; and most importantly, the idea of a happy family. Indeed, the book explores the extent to which one could go to protect their children, but here the family is explored to much darker depths (pun intended). It also examines the almost fascist tendency of entitlement in the middle classes who detest any signs of 'weakness' — the Lohmans are representative of the very section of the middle classes which believes in a certain opportunistic, climate change-denying, racist and almost misanthropic white male ethos; fueled by violence and an affinity towards a twisted sense of violent vigilantism. This book is a reminder that people really can test all limits to protect their 'unhappy families' (with a direct and recurring reference to Tolstoy'a  Anna Karenina  ). It makes most people extremely uncomfortable to indulge and invest in any discussion of ideas they themselves are opposed to, and therefore this book proves to be an extremely challenging read. In fact, the 'defect' or 'illness' Paul Lohman believes he may have passed onto his son Michel can perhaps be seen as a metaphor for the supremacist state of entitlement that the characters represent. From the state of the Goodreads Reviews section, one can see that most emerge out of the experience belching 3 star reviews — as I myself initially found myself doing, too — but in all fairness, this is a real gourmet, a clear picture of which develops only over time, and only for those who make it through the unpleasantness and can see through Herman Koch's efforts. But what  really  makes  The Dinner  deserving of another star, in my eyes, is the central trope it sets out to emulate (and thereby, to ridicule): fine dining. From the months-long wait-list and the the small portions on nearly empty plates, to the maître de's descriptions of the sources of the ingredients —  'organic farms' where the animals 'lived in freedom' before they were butchered  — and the pinkie finger pointed and inching ever so close to the food; the haute cuisine experience is ripped apart as one with a heavy concentration of pretentious fluff.  The Dinner  is an excellent crime thriller that warrants at least a 4 star tip and a hearty recommendation. It certainly does not leave a good taste in the mouth, but for reasons much more favourable than you'd assume. [I also believe that the Atlantic paperback edition of this book in the Cult Classics series is exceptionally well done, right from the English translation of the Dutch text by Sam Garrett, to the arresting cover design.]</text></scrape>
