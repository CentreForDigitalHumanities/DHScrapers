It was disturbing enough that I struggled to get to sleep. I found, like some of the other reviewers, that having such a sensitive conversation in a restaurant was highly unlikely. I was left wondering if the main character was diagnosed with psychopathy and if his son had inherited this or was the behaviour learned. A very dislikeable group of characters and I felt the politician came out of it all looking the best of a bad bunch. It does make you ponder how far you would go for your children but I really doubt many would go as far as this couple. I did enjoy the social commentary of the Dutch living in France and am sure this same commentary is applicable to the British as well. I also thought the commentary of how people react to 'famous' people was accurate. </text></scrape>
