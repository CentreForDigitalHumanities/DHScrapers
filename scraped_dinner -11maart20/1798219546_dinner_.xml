First, the fact that the setting is in an upscale restaurant was interesting to me since I love going out for dinner. Paul's cynical view and often realistic comments about what is really going on in such establishments was quite spot-on and funny. His comments about his brother and politicians was also sharp and amusing.As we read the book, we peel away the layers and slowly get to know more about the characters, about their families and their secrets. The story evolves and it becomes darker, our perspective on the main characters changes to a point where we realize the good guys are not the ones we initially thought.Also makes you wonder how far you'd go to save your children's future, and keep some secrets buried.I can't wait to discover more books of that author.</text></scrape>
