The pace of the book was VERY slow, I knew it was building to something, but I did feel like some of the flashbacks were out of place or unnecessary. There were a few that seemed so random that it was hard to understand how they served the purpose of the story. Otherwise, I thought the concept was interesting; how far parents will go to protect their children. I felt like the motives in protecting the children were more selfish, and less about actually protecting the kids. I was surprised at Claire's reaction. My understanding of her character shifted partway through the book. In general, the concept was good, but the execution was poor. </text></scrape>
