While I do not hate this book with the passion I reserve for "We have to Talk About Kevin", I do not like this book Sam I Am.In spite of the 1st person narration (which weaves back and forth, revealing pieces bit by bit), the tone has a dispassionate tone, to me, even while the narrator is revealed to not be merely a slightly irritable man, but moves along the spectrum to judgmental, to asshat, and so on and so on. The other characters do not fare much better really.While not wanting to give away the story, although there are plenty of plot summaries about, I think that the author took an easy way out of the premise of the book, going for shocking and even less believable, as opposed to exploring the social realities and the biases driving the event which started this particular ball of story rolling. Not, mind you, that I would have been inclined to read THAT book either but this is not an honest book, it has its agenda which, apparently, has sold a lot of books. Just for that dishonesty, I can't give this a higher rating, and it probably ends up at 1.5 for me.(view spoiler)[I wonder if Claire had the same disease, I think she was scarier than Paul, by the end it... and why wasn't Paul in jail for the principal? And why did Serge not go ahead with his original intent? After all that you would think it would have impressed him to pursue it even more? These seem like lazy things to me, on the part of the author... (hide spoiler)]</text></scrape>
