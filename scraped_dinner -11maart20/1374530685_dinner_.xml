Just as fantastic. I still don't understand any negative reviews; this story is told brilliantly and voiced perfectly by Clive Mantle. It's been almost two years since I had read it and I couldn't remember many of the details of the book, so I was still surprised over and over again. I could recommend either book or audio, they are both great. The best word I can think of to describe this book really is simply brilliant.</text></scrape>
