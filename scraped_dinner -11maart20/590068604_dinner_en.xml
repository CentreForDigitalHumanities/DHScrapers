I even read several reviews to try to figure this out. However, I couldn't find a single reason, so will chalk it up as one of those books that make people react strongly. Even though there are a lot of 3 star reviews, the reviewers have strong feelings about the book, strong "meh" feelings.Me? I really liked the book, but will qualify that with saying the narrator of the audiobook had a lot to do with that. His intonations and portrayal of the mentally unstable narrator sizzled.This book is billed as the "European Gone Girl". Not having read Gone Girl, I can't comment on that, but it has given me a reason to consider reading GG when I had made up my mind that I wouldn't. Paul Lohman, "laid off" schoolteacher, father of Michele, a teenage boy, who commits a dastardly murder along with his cousin, son of Prime Minister candidate, Serge Lohman, narrates the story. The story takes place at an uppity restaurant with the idea of the parents figuring out what they are going to do about their children and their children's future. WARNING: There are no likeable characters in this novel. 4.0 stars</text></scrape>
