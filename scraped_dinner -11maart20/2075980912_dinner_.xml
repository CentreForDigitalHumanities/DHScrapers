I couldn't have hated it more. The satirical element does not convince. By which I mean I can't shake the horrid impression that the author himself isn't sure the despicable characters in his book are really all that despicable. Maybe I'm all wrong. Maybe he's empathetic and intelligent in real life and this really was a (heavy-handed/clumsy) skewering of bourgeois entitlement and family-first egoism. But several factors make me doubt it, including the lazy and irresponsible allusions to Asperger's as a rationale/excuse for sociopathic violence. Ugh. I need something hopeful in tone to counteract this depressing book, something considerate of the reader's intelligence. </text></scrape>
