It started out quite harmlessly, with some mild humor, but nothing ground-breaking, but once the entree is served things quite literally heat up a bit. The book is divided up by parts of the dinner(Aperitif, Appetizer, etc.) and one does feel tension starting to build as each course arrives. Still, I did not expect what happened in the end and I can't say I am pleased with it. The whole book is strange, that sounds so simplistic, but I cannot find another word. I do not like a single character, though of all of them, Serge is tolerable, which is ironic as he is meant to come across as the least likeable. It does make you think a bit, about what one would do for people one loves, but ultimately, it didn't particularly touch me, because there was too little humanity and too few(if any) sympathetic characters. Not a must read, but a fast-paced, entertaining book nonetheless.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com</text></scrape>
