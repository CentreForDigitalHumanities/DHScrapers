There is potential for a thoughtful examination of some of the nasty issues that roil underneath the surface of self-identified 'civilized' societies. There's the possibility of exploring the uses of an unreliable narrator. Unfortunately, however, the author squanders these opportunities by being far too eager to telegraph every unreliable aspect of the book's narrator, every plot twist, every 'shocking' attitude or behaviour by the book's main characters. I was mildly intrigued by the first, oh, half of the book (hence the two stars), but I can pinpoint the moment where I thought, "Oh, please," and suddenly had had enough of the heavy-handed narrative, the occasional intentional coyness that just comes across as a lazy cop-out, and the need for MAJOR suspension of disbelief for certain plot points to work.</text></scrape>
