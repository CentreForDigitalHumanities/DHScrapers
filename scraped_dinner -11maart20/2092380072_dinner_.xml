Let me explain. it starts rather interesting, I fancied the style of the author /since this was my first book by Koch/. However, up until the Main course the characters are represented quite shallowly. Only after the culmination was when I really enjoyed this book. I did change my mind about it. And I am writing this paragraph now, because this hadn't happened to me in a while. I either liked other books from the beginning and went on to gradually enjoy them even more until the very end, or they just wouldn't catch me. Now, on Paul and his story. I am not going to talk about all characters, as it would be unduly. However, Paul deserves a line or two in order to convey the spirit of the book. Looking at him, I can only contradict with myself. His marriage, for example, is at first sight quite normal: it has had some turbulence over the years, but he and his wife seem to manage quite well currently, and they also seem to love each other. But Paul and Claire are rather peculiar people. And they have ended up together for the right reasons. I am not going to discuss whether they have made the right decisions bringing up their son and regarding their relatives. But I must say that I ended up liking them in the end. I could never relate to Paul and I would never act like him in such a situation, but I understood him in his rather realistic view of life. See, some people are going to stigmatize his character and they would be right. After all, if all people were like him /or any of the other characters really/ the world would be much a worse place. This is one of the things many don't like about this book: the characters are not good people. Yes, they are not, the do not do any wonders, the only care for themselves. But so do most of us. The fact that I cannot afford to dine in posh restaurants, doesn't mean that I am not 'selfish' myself, that I wouldn't do much to protect my child. Though, yes, I wouldn't do anything....And, in the end, I really liked the point of another reviewer here, on Goodreads, I read before I began the book. They said "Who would go to discuss such a private matter in a public restaurant?". I guess, I will have to reflect a tad longer, before I could answer myself on that one. </text></scrape>
