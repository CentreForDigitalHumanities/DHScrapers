I'm calling bullshit on this book. I read a review somewhere which said that Herman Koch's 'The Dinner' is a 'European "Gone Girl"'. This, in itself, seems interesting enough, so I decided to give the Dutch 'instant classic' a go, and to see if it lives up to the hype. And my God, it's not even close. ENTRYThere's a number of interesting things that go totally wrong in this book. Nevertheless, I kept reading - who doesn't like a good trainwreck, after all. It's interesting what Koch tries to do in his book. In another universe, and with better stylistic and pure imaginative control, it might have actually worked. Paul and his wife Claire go to dinner with Paul's brother Serge and his wife Babette. It all seems fine and dandy, but we immediately notice that there are some unresolved issues in the air. So far, so good.MAIN COURSEKoch clearly does not want us to like any of his characters. He makes them act like total jerks throughout the entire book, the narrator not excluded. Half of the book -scratch that, all of the book- consists of people being irritated, overly emotional in their reactions, aggressive and downright annoying. The poor staff at the restaurant never seems to catch a break, do they? This unability to identify with the characters is not a problem in se - I've read a number of books with unlikeable characters over the years. The problem lies in Koch's style. It's so simple and frankly utterly boring. There is no risk whatsoever in his description, there is no appeal, no attraction, no fascination whatsoever. This immediately deconstructs the whole building of the characters. Especially because Koch does literally nothing but describe and tell stuff.DESSERTGood readers might remember that golden rule 'show, don't tell'. A good author will insinuate, not just blurt out everything from the get-go. Koch leaves no room for imagination. 'The Dinner' takes you by the hand, but it's a sweaty hand, uncomfortable, unwanted even. In the mean time, Koch continues to try and offend the reader. World War II insights about victims not being innocent, cheap violence, even cheaper violence, a variation on cheap violence, the repeated wish to commit violence. But to be frank, he writes it all down in a way that would not even offend my grandmother. DIGESTIVESo, ultimately, we are left with an obsessively controlling book with a hook that isn't even all that great, far too few plot twists, a ridiculous story-line, to be frank (what were they even doing in the restaurant? who the hell goes to a fancy places to talk murder issues?), some admittedly hilariously bad dialogue and characters so bland you could not even make a cardboard box out of them. THE BILLI'll grant 'The Dinner' one thing. It's a quick read. And if this can hit the best-seller lists, well, then I guess there's still hope for dabbling writers like myself. But in the end, I just feel like Koch is simply a bad writer. I find it strange that he has managed to offend people with a book this bland. Perhaps I'm just used to a more extreme standard, but to compare this to 'Gone Girl', for example, is like comparing the lethality of a broccoli with that of a shotgun. So don't waste your money on 'The Dinner'. Better yet, go have an actual dinner some place nice. You won't have missed a beat. </text></scrape>
