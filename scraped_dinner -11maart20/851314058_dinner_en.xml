It is the sixth book I have read for the Tournament of Books (ToB X). So far, I have been in India, Nebraska, Pakistan, Philadelphia, Rhode Island, Micronesia and with this book, the Netherlands for the second time. I have learned about a cure for death and the consequences of finding it; I have read about botany and the study of mosses and how to succeed in business if you are unscrupulous among other issues. I thought I was prepared for anything to happen in The Dinner.I was wrong. I knew this book was about a familial problem that two brothers need to solve. The novel appeared quite civilized. It takes place over a meal in a fancy restaurant and the sections are titled with parts of a dinner - aperitif through digestif. However, the problem turns out to be uncivilized and in some ways quite frightening.Once again this is a novel that I never would have encountered without ToB X. I can't even imagine finding it to try it without this incentive. I don't read many European authors unless they are writing mysteries. I cannot say that I liked this book. I think the writing was excellent, that the characters will stay in my mind for awhile and I do wish I had someone to discuss it with. But these people are not likable.I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to be disturbed by human behavior, for readers who like to be challenged by their novels and to folks who are willing to realize that there may be evil in the world.</text></scrape>
