Escapes the thriller throttle. Most comments by my peers seem very negative. They can’t believe people are so nasty. And probably the question of the murder of a homeless person is not worthwhile. And that is what it’s about – the author related that it was about.... a specifically named woman who was murdered. The rest is the rationalisation of the event, the refusal of justice. It takes place in a swanky restaurant, which just points up the wealth and entitlement of the players. It’s social injustice in action, dramatising the sense of entitlement of the well-to-do. Almost you can see it as a dramatisation of a dictum of Paul Piff: As a person’s levels of wealth increase, their feelings of compassion and empathy go down, and their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness, and their ideology of self-interest increases. And incidentally, it is excellently translated.</text></scrape>
