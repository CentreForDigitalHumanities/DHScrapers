But, I really didn't like this book. A few quick reasons why: 1) the vagueness (just tell us what put Claire in the hospital, what "psychological illness" the main character, Paul, was suffering from, the name of the school Paul taught at, the time of evening Paul's wife called home to talk to their son, etc, etc!) 2)the fact that this family chose an outrageously pretentious and ridiculously over-priced restaurant to discuss such a serious matter at (why would they risk other people hearing what they were talking about?) The only reason I was inclined to keep reading was because the unraveling of the story took it's time and as a reader, I DID want to know what was going to "go down" at the restaurant. The narrator, Paul, was so unlikable, even more so as the novel progressed. But this isn't a reason to not like the book - I've read books where the characters were unlikable, but still liked the book (for ex. Gone Girl). And sometimes, it's very possible to root for the "bad" guy, even though you don't really want to admit it (think Walter White), but not one ounce of me had empathy or sympathy for this family. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed and unsatisfied when I finished this book. </text></scrape>
