However, in fact the actual discussion doesn’t take that much space, only about the last fifty pages of the book. The largest part of it concerns what happened, the act itself, and the motive. Why do these boys basically torture and kill homeless people for fun? The answer is harrowing, but more frightening still is the position of the parents of the main perpetrator, the son of the narrator. They insist upon defending the child, blaming the homeless woman who had no business sleeping inside an ATM compartment. The dehumanization of the victim to defend the privileged middle class boys was undoubtedly the most compelling part of the novel.Some reviewers mention the author’s insistence upon hereditary violence; the father is violent and so the son is violent as well, as if said violence was genetically inherited. I, however, prefer to read it in another way. The son often witnesses the father being violent. It’s not so much that violence is inherited as a disease, but rather by example. The son becomes accustomed to violence against others not because of some kind of blood curse, but because the father spent his life normalizing it. Still much more could have been done with this premise. The social aspects that the author tries to include deserved more development, and perhaps a better conclusion. Some parts of the novel seemed poorly constructed in an attempt to create suspense, namely, the narrative jumps were not entirely clear. However, it is an engaging read, and the main character, the father, Paul, was a disturbingly well constructed character. I do recommend it!</text></scrape>
