The facade of civility gets, layer by layer, stripped away as the evening progresses, revealing murderous secrets. Paul is misanthropic and at first you think he hates pretentious people, one of those guys, but you soon very well find out that he's got a lot of hate to pass around for everybody. If you are interested in psychological thrillers, this may be entertaining. I finished this in a single reading because it is easy to read but it didn't interest me, except for the fact that the ending is shallow. It feels poignant now on another level, where it feels like nobody cares about anybody but themselves... The Dinner shows what happens when you consider selfishness a moral good in and of itself, so things like irrational rage, violent anger are goods when exercised to fight for one's own existence.</text></scrape>
