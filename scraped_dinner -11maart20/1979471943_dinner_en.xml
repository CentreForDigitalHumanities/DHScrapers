It was a time spent in the mind of a person who seemed fine at first, but wasn’t; whose family, not counting sibling rivalry, appeared normal and happy at first, but weren’t. This adventure was like watching a bad accident in slow motion – when do you turn your head, and do you? How do you describe what happened, and can you? Should you? If you enjoy psychological thrillers, this is a must-read book. For me it took the words “psychological” and “thriller” into a whole other realm. If you belong to a book club and haven’t yet explored this book, bump it to the top of your list!</text></scrape>
