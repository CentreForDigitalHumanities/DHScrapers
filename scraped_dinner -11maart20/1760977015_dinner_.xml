I had no idea what I was getting into!To me, this is a 4.5 star book, worthy of the round-up. I thought the story was exquisitely written: slow-rising, sneaky, intelligent, entertaining, even thrilling in a "thriller" type way. It was a page-turner for me. I couldn't stop. I think it will be one of the most memorable for me this year. (Worth mentioning that I listened to the audio version, which was really, really well done.)No, I didn't like the storyline, or the characters -- who would!? -- but the story sunk in deep. And even better, the writing was fantastic, I thought. I didn't know I was being led to the place I went until it was far too late. Recommended! (I don't understand the reviews of those who didn't like this book -- friends included!) </text></scrape>
