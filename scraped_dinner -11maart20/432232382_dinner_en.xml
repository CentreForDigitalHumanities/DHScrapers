The entire book revolves around two brothers and their wives who meet for dinner to discuss their boysâ€™ problems and try to make a difficult decision that can change the course of their lives. A disturbing book that I could not put down. It was dark, it was suspenseful, it was strange, it was attention grabbing, it was thought provoking. It kept me guessing right to the end. Highly recommend but not for those who like uplifting, light reading.</text></scrape>
