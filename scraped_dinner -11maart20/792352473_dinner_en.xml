It is pretty serious, and a bit sad. I have an addiction to books with short chapters.It's not yet at the stage were I desperately seek out book with short chapters, it is simply that once I've got a short chaptered book in my hands I'll read it through compulsively. Sometimes I don't even enjoy it that much. I probably need a twelve step programme. I wouldn't like to imagine just quite how bad this could get.Anyway, this book is all about the plot and the narrator and so this review will be purposefully vague to try to avoid anything that might spoil the story. The central conceit is that a family are meeting for dinner to discuss something serious involving their children. Present at the dinner are two brothers, the younger of whom is the narrator, and their wives. The story is written from a period of time several months after the dinner while the narration is broken up by flashbacks to earlier points in time. Technically I felt that the writing was strong. The narrator had a constant and compelling voice, although the translation was either by an American or prepared with the mighty US market in mind so I had to endure asses, cellphones and checks instead of the familiar dulcet notes of my native dialect.Does it go without saying these days that if a book has single viewpoint narration that the narrator is not going to be entirely objective or neutral?The problem I suspect for this book is in the cause of the serious matter. Here the cover blurb How far would you go to protect the ones you love? is almost completely misleading, unless more people are more severely disturbed than I imagine even on my gloomiest days in my months of bleakness during the black years of negativity of the decades of despair. But who knows, maybe there are. It helps to be open minded about these things.The serious matter has a medical cause which is either going to work for you as a reader or not. On the one hand it make it difficult to read the novel as an allegory of Dutch society, except for the 'lets go and hang all the Fascists' angle of how you manage, er, socially disruptive forms of diversity within the confines of a society that aspires to an ideal of toleration and inclusivity. On the other hand this is neatly tied in the story by the quote from Tolstoy's Anna Karenina; all happy families are alike, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Then of course the issue is so specific because the author chooses to have a medical rather than a social cause for it that wider relevance is restricted and you are only left with how far the narrative voice and technique wins you over as a reader.Not a book that will please everyone, even though it is surprisingly humorous in places. </text></scrape>
