It reminded me of Defending Jacob, Stephen's King's Apt Pupil, and something else. Just disturbing. It's a dark comedy in a horrifying way, and literally not ONE of the characters is someone to root for. A more selfish, unfeeling, disturbed group of people you will (hopefully!) never meet...except perhaps in Congress (in ANY country).It's bone-chilling in how it's told. The pompous arrogance of the rich, the disturbing idea of "let boys be boys and kids be kids" with apparently no consequences for their actions, racism (especially the "look, I'm so great because I adopted a child of a different color than myself" variety that thankfully isn't TOO common, but when it does appear, is very ugly), the conniving of politics, the family loyalty above all else...LITERALLY all else! The whole thing is despicable, in a can't-take-your-eyes off it kind of way. The first 1/4 of the book was a little slow for me, and I nearly gave up on it, but while I won't say I was necessarily glad I stuck it out (purely based on the disturbing subject matter), the story definitely picked up a bit and went wildly in a direction I did not expect. At the end, my thoughts were basically "holy crap, that was messed up!"4/5</text></scrape>
