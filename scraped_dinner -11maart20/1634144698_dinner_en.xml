I thought it was a great book on several levels--One, the story itself, about the families discussing a criminal matter of their children (cousins) over dinner in a la-di-dah posh restaurant. One brother is a well-known politician, so I wondered, why in the world air your dirty laundry in public? But if you subscribe to the theory that a break-up is best done in public so everyone "behaves" themselves and no tantrums are thrown, then this makes sense especially for the politician. Then many, many book club discussion points about parenting--to mention one, why does a couple have a child, adopt another child and yet feel they need to rescue a nephew? Do they think they're super parents? The narrator has a great quote, "..a world without disasters and violence--be it the violence of nature or that or muscle and blood--that would truly be the unbearable thing.", and you know what direction his support will be. Then all the great commentary about the fussiness of the restaurant! Especially compared to the local pub that has "real" food and "real" people next door. I've been in Amsterdam and even the locals comment on how bad the service is, although I thought tipping wasn't as big a deal there as here. Of course the tip here is more of a bribe. Bonus points for this being a quick read too. Great for traveling! </text></scrape>
