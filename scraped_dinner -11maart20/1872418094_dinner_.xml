Tarty, spicy, sour, well-seasoned – but never sweet, even when it is time for desserts – this dinner date demands your utmost attention like any dinner dates. That is not to say you won’t look for a chance to excuse yourself from the table because the date is not going well, but simply that you are too terrified of the consequences if the Lohmans were to find out that you are onto their “happy-family casually enjoying a fancy dinner at a restaurant” facade.  Parenting is hard. Just ask Claire or Babette while drinking that glass of wine. Not Serge, though – Serge knows what to do and his heart is in the right place. But would you ask a prime ministerial candidate for his advice on parenting? Babette and Claire will probably throw some platitudes about parenting or continue to eat their food – but what are they not telling you? In any case, do NOT ask Paul, just don’t. But again, if Paul is the only one willing to talk – you have no choice but to ask him – at least, to end the awkward silence that is hovering around the table. When desserts are served, however, you are just glad you only have a dinner date with them and that you don’t have to go home to/with them.The characters are feisty, scary and the writing is sharp, insightful, direct. The narrator Paul Lohman makes you go from adoring him when the appetizers are served, to sympathizing when the main course arrives and when the desserts are brought to your table – you simply can’t wait to grab him by the collars and “knuckle him in the face, below the nose”. The others - Claire, Babette, Serge, Michel, Rick – will keep those pages turning for you. To sum up, ‘The dinner’ is violent, edgy, and thrilling. Cannot wait to dig into other books by Herman Koch.</text></scrape>
