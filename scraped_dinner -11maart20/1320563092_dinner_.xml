There was not one single likeable character in this novel. So if you need/demand likeable characters, look elsewhere, you won't find them here, lol.Two couples meet at a very exclusive Amsterdam restaurant. Paul and Claire Lohman and Serge and Babette Lohman. Serge is a famous politician, likely to become the next Prime Minister. Most of the novel takes place over dinner in the restaurant. While waiting for his brother and his wife to arrive, Paul, our narrator, makes all sorts of interesting observations about the restaurant, about his wife and especially about his brother whom he seems to resent greatly. As the novel progresses, their true selves slowly show themselves to reveal psychopathic personalities. Usually there's only 1 or 2 characters in the book/family who are Sociopaths, Not just about everyone! Where I liked the darkness of this book and so wanted to give it another star...I couldn't buy into the fact that No One outside of their family suspected the boys, Rick & Michel of killing the homeless woman & Beau!?? And that Paul wasn't arrested for beating the daylights out of the school Principal??! That being said my favorite sociopath in the book was Claire, Truly Whacked Out!!!!</text></scrape>
