It can hardly be described as enjoyable and is uncomfortable reading throughout. None of the main characters are likeable but it holds the reader's attention completely, perhaps because of that most interesting of features, an unreliable narrator. At several stages during the book the reader is unsure how the story will unfold. This unpredictability adds to the interest... almost like slowing down to look at a car crash, though the subject matter is unpleasant, the writing is compelling. From the outset we know from the media reviews that something horrific has happened involving the sons of two couples whose fathers are brothers, the narrator, and Serge, who is about to stand for Dutch Prime Minister. The issue is to be 'discussed' over dinner at a top restaurant between the two sets of parents. This is a dark piece of contemporary fiction unfortunately very relevant to the society we live in.</text></scrape>
