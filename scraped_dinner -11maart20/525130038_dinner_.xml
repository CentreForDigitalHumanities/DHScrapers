Koch’s technique is masterful – he draws the reader in from the first page and his somewhat matter-of-fact and dispassionate technique of painting his characters is oddly fitting as the story unfolds. Two couples meet for dinner at an upscale restaurant on a warm summer evening in Amsterdam – an outing that most would expect would be an enjoyable and relaxing one. But off the bat, something is amiss and as the evening progresses over the many dinner courses, we witness how alarming, deceitful, callous and manipulating people are – as they justify actions or lack thereof – in the name of protecting family members and the status quo. Koch’s story includes some of the current social issues and dilemmas, which form the basis for actions that lead to questionable decisions. This book leaves one with a disturbing "ickiness" – a feeling engendered by a great story line and character development, not by Koch’s writing technique, which is rather successful.</text></scrape>
