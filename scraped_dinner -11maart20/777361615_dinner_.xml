(view spoiler)[ The main character had a condition that caused uncontrollable violence. His son inherited it. His wife chose it. I can't decide which of them was more despicable.  (hide spoiler)] I began the book expecting some sort of snooze fest over dinner, which progressed to dislike of the main character's pettiness, which quickly turned to horror. I finished simply because I just couldn't accept that things wouldn't turn around. I wish I had been warned; I could have saved myself the disgust and nightmares. You have been warned.</text></scrape>
