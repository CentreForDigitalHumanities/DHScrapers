What a way to start a new year. I started listening to the audio version and got so hooked I ran out and bought the book so I could finish it faster. This novel is so incredibly fucked up, but so well done you can’t put it down. ( hence I read it in a day). Family, happiness, loyalty, and love are central in this book. “ What would you do to protect a loved one?”There wasn’t a single character in the book that I liked. I found them all to be self absorbed and truly broken people. What I find most interesting in the novel is the personality disorders that at least three of the characters have. There were moments when their actions or words made your spine chill. </text></scrape>
