Would we go so far as these two sets of parents? This was a very well written story that had my emotions swinging from sympathy to disgust and everything between.The narrator had my dander up very early on when he described why he generally sits facing out in restaurants...."it's not that Claire goes out of her way to appease me. It's just something she has inside her, a sort of inner calm or depth that makes her content with blank walls and open kitchens.....That's all she seems to need: that, and a view of my face." Wow, what arrogance.This bit made me laugh "But sometimes I couldn't help but think that it was all much simpler than that, that Babette had merely signed up for something, for a life at the side of a successful politician, and that it would have been a waste of all the time she'd invested to stop now - the way you don't put aside a bad book when you're halfway through it. You finish it reluctantly - that's the way she'd stayed with Serge. Perhaps the ending would make up for some of it."Finally, this truth "Sometimes things come out of your mouth that you regret later on. Or no, not regret. You say something so razor-sharp that the person you say it to carries it around with them for the rest of their life."</text></scrape>
