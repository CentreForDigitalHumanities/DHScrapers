Up until the final 20 pages or so.Like most suspense novels I've read in the past few years (Gone Girl, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc.), I mostly found this to be unrealistic. But the book was well organized, and enough was left unsaid to keep me guessing, so I suspended belief and bought in.As dinner unfolds, we learn more and more about the terrible crime committed by the children of the dinner guests, and eagerly read on, anticipating a resolution.But there isn't one. The book just ends after a completely unrealistic fight scene between two of the participants. My major issues:- Only 1 of the dinner guests seems to find it problematic that his child committed murder, and not even for the right reasons-- he's only worried about how it will affect his political career. Supposedly the fact that homeless people smell justifies murder?- All of the parents knew about the murder, but nobody told their spouse-- even when they saw their own children on TV committing the act, they just drank wine and pretended not to notice.- Two of the characters kill a third (their brother and cousin, respectively) to cover it up. Nobody seems to mind this either, including the parents of the dead boy-- they put a notice in the paper that he's missing right before the book ends, but his disappearance is handled nonchalantly.- There is no justice. There is no accountability. Nobody is responsible. I finished the book, and felt completely unsatisfied. The whole book is about a dinner to fix a problem, and the problem isn't fixed. The book tries to wrap it up neatly with a quick murder/violent outburst, but it doesn't really make a lot of sense, and it doesn't fix anything. There is no way this would play out this way in real life. I felt totally cheated. </text></scrape>
