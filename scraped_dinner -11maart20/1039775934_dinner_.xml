It is scary in its extreme cruelty for no apparent reason other than boredom. It is a study in despicable parenting- those who are full of excuses, refuse to hold their children accountable, and/or simply shove the problems off onto someone else. If all else fails, it will be swept under the rug as quietly as possible.  I remember watching a Judge Judy episode where a mom was publicly (being a nationally syndicated show) imploring the judge to spare her teen from charges in breaking and entering, vandalism, and some other goodies. Reason? The other teen "started it" even if her own child ruined the interior walls, broke a couple of windows, and participated in the theft. Lovely! I wonder what crimes that teen will graduate to with that spectacular parental example. Similarly, this book exposes the darker side of human nature, particularly the lengths we are willing to go to in order to save our own skin. I actually felt sick as I read towards the middle and had to put it down for a bit.  Four nasty people go to a fancy restaurant and think vile things about one another. There is extensive detail in the atmosphere of the restaurant, appearance of waitstaff, and grumbling of these diners that perfectly sets up the dark subject of "the dinner".  I understand the one star reviews. It makes you feel quite icky icky. Unfortunately, this is a plausible, if disturbing truth about some crimes and the author told the story quite well. It is a quick read and worth it simply to find out what happens if nothing else.</text></scrape>
