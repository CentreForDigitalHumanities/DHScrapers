I liked the initial idea and was expecting a kind of one scene deal with everything unfolding at the dinner table and all the resultant tension, but this was not the case. Instead, it rambled and drifted off on tangents that were not really necessary, even if the author tried to tie them in at the end. It would have been better if it were more focused and trimmed down a bit. The ending was also faintly ridiculous. I know it is supposed to emphasise the lengths that parents will go to protect their children but their decisions and actions were bizarre, even taking this original premise in to account. Overall, I was struck at times by the We Need To Talk About Kevin similarities (although this probably is not as well written) and I did not enjoy that either. Perhaps I'm just not interested in parent-troubled teen-murder books</text></scrape>
