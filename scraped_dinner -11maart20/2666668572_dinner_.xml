One of the worst books I have ever read. None of the characters were likable and the main event of the book was incredibly disturbing, only to be trumped by the reaction of said event by two of the main characters in the book. A book about the lengths parents will go to to protect their children, but the way it was told left me never wanting to read another book by this author.</text></scrape>
