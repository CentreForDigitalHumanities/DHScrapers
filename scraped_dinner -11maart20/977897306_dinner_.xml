Herman Koch is a Dutch author. This novel, one of two translated into English, takes place over a dinner, from aperitif to digestif. Two brothers and their wives meet for dinner at an exclusive Amsterdam restaurant. The place is the type where reservations need to be made 3 months in advance. However, one of the brothers is Serge Lohman, most likely the next Prime Minister.The families share a secret and they are here to discuss it. Paul Lohman is the novel's narrator. He and his wife also share a secret which is slowly revealed. Your first reaction to Paul will not be good, I can assure you. But that is part of the beauty of the story.I am always taken with books that veer off the expected course - just when you think you have it figured out and think "good job, author, but I have you down," that author puts another dimension in the writing and leaves you trying to figure it out all over again.Secrets, "familial" feeling, teenage sons, adopted children, plot twists and turns and an ambiguous ending are all here. If you like to read a book that you HAVE to finish before you can 1) go to sleep 2) make dinner 3)feed the kids or 4) get out of bed, by all means read this. You won't want to put it down.I didn't. </text></scrape>
