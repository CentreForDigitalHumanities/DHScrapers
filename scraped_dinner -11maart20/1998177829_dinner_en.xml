Arnold</author><rating>really liked it</rating><text>This was my book club's May book, and what an interesting read it was. I assumed I wasn't going to like it and I was admittedly turned off by the author's style during the first few chapters. I wasn't too into the idea of the story playing out and being slowly revealed throughout the course of one dinner. It felt odd to me. But it wasn't odd, it was just different. After a few chapters I really started to get into it, and I started to appreciate the author's style. I've always been able to visualize well while I'm reading, as I'm sure most readers are, but with this particular book that visualization ability was on another level. The way Koch writes I could see every little minute detail of the restaurant in my mind, every facial expression and feature of the characters. I began anticipating their little ticks and subtle smirks without him even needing to tell me they were making those faces anymore. And he does this without ever over-describing or going on loftily written tangents. The suspense was built well. It's one of those books where you start off thinking you know a character, or start off thinking you know which character probably has the biggest moral deficiency...and then it changes. And changes. There are parts where the author weaves social and political statements into the book that aren't really part of the narrative but make a point nonetheless (where he talks about people using "nice" adjectives to describe gay men or black men when those gay and black men exude certain qualities that they consider "nice" as opposed to the qualities they would stereotypical assume them to have). However, there are other parts in the book where I was just left taken aback and confused by what the author was trying to say. Like when he mentions going to see a psychiatrist and being diagnosed with a disorder named after the German doctor who founded it. I literally stopped reading and ran through all of the possible mental and neurological illnesses in my head. Then I had to put the book down and Google to see what other people were saying. It turns out he was alluding to Asperger's, but didn't want to say Asperger's out right out of fear of backlash. Which, if I'm being honest, the backlash would be completely warranted...seeing as he doesn't really paint Asperger's in the best light and the narrator doesn't show any previous hint of having it prior to page 185. There are other parts in the book where the author refuses to say things, like what sickness his wife had or what hospital she was being treated at, among other things. It's almost like this is a memoir instead of a novel and he's trying to evade liability. It's weird, but I digress. The book as a whole is pretty intriguing, layered, and thought provoking. It's also distinctively dark, but not in a trying to be dark kind of way. I don't know how I feel about the ending, but I will say this: While I don't think anyone in this story has Asperger's, I do think there are multiple sociopaths. </text></scrape>
