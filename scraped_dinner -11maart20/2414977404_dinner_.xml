The narrator was insanely unlikeable, without the charm or charisma needed to make you forget what a horrible person he is. I like thrillers, especially ones with little substance, but they need to be well written and less predictable, or if they’re going to be predicable, then worth the ride. This one was not. I also had a ton of problems with how Beau was used as a one-dimensional plot point and with that totally useless, awkward conversation about race and American film portrayals of black characters early on in the text. These characters were awful human beings and the choices Koch made while crafting the plot seemed both gratuitous and shallow, making this book ultimately not for me. In conclusion, just read Gone Girl. So much better!Updated to add: After reading other reviews and realizing (Spoiler!) that Paul’s diagnosis by the doctor is alluding to Asperger’s, this has to be a one-star book for me.</text></scrape>
