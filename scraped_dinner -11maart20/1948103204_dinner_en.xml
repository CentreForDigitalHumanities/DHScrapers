The Dinner was a book that has been quite famous around the book community, I've heard the title and the author mentioned several times, but I decided to read this book pretty much randomly and on a whim. Fun fact, this is also the first ebook I read on my new Amazon Kindle 8th generation, which I bought a few months ago because I no longer use a Barnes and Noble Nook.What pulled me into this book was the fact that the whole book was set in a single moment, which is a dinner the main character had with his wife, his brother and his brother's wife. It was much, much more than a dinner, however, as we slowly know and understand the four characters deeply and the characters surrounding them, especially their children.I thought, knowing that the whole book will focus a lot on a span of time of around several hours, that on some times it would drag on, that the writer will make the narration a little too long and boring just to make it into a novel-sized story. But it didn't seem like that at all to me. The narrator, the main character, did observe a lot of stuff that happened in that dinner. Starting from the moment he walked into the restaurant, the waiters, the people sitting in the restaurants, to the food and his thoughts on them. He also talked a lot about his wife, and his thoughts (most of them not very good thoughts) on other people, the food, the atmosphere in the restaurant, even the bathroom. However there were also moments where flashbacks are inserted, which made the whole book less boring. I was also quite surprised to find that I didn't hate the main character, despite his annoying and very, very flawed personality. I think I always never minded reading about flawed, annoying, sometimes even slightly psychologically sick narrators without disliking them and getting sick of reading through their perspective, and the same applies to this book.The other characters were also flawed and interesting, and they are all very well-written. I really liked the main character's relationship with his wife, and how he acts around his son. I liked that despite the fact that we don't see much of the children in the dinner itself, we actually got to know them quite well.The whole arc of the story focuses on a small secret, a sort of mystery that the main character half-knows, and as the dinner progresses we begin to know little by little what this mystery is. I think this is another reason why the whole dinner didn't get boring, it was because the author intelligently reveals the little intrigue, small detail by small detail, until at the end we find out everything about it and the characters address them bluntly, and we are left to choose for ourselves, what would we do in that situation? It's a very ambiguous conflict, more of an internal conflict that has no correct answer, no bad guy, no right or wrong answer, and so the readers are just left with their own opinions and their curiosity as to what will the characters do next.Knowing that this book was written originally in Dutch, and me myself having lived in the Netherlands for over a year now, I can sort of feel the translated language a little. That doesn't change the fact that the story itself is remarkable, and that the writing style, however different it must be because it was translated, is quite unique and easy to read. I enjoyed reading this book quite a lot, and I actually look forward to reading more of Herman Koch in the future.Bookmarks:Happiness needs nothing but itself, it doesn't have to be validated.
