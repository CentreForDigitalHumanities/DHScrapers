The mystery is very slowly built. A lot of time is spent on flashbacks, which was a bit of a drag sometimes. The characters were unlikable, like they were intended to be, but I didn't hate them as much as I should. More accurately, I didn't feel anything for them. They were neither good characters nor good villains. That, of course, brings me to another question - are they even villains? What would I have done in their place? This wasn't the best book I've ever read, but it seemed right up my alley, especially when I saw it compared to Gone Girl. The suspense kept me turning pages, I simply had to know what would happen. </text></scrape>
