While some have complained that the beginning is slow, I think that Koch establishes his characters perfectly - particularly with Paul's relateable, snarky comments. Once the "Main Course" started to fall into place, I read the second half of the book in one sitting. Shocking without being over the top or unbelievable, The Dinner deserves all of its bestselling praise. </text></scrape>
