What would you do to protect your child? Two sets of parents meet to discuss the horrible act each of their sons have performed together, and how they intend to deal with it.I couldn't relate to any of the characters, but I enjoyed the book overall. It caused me to realize that what you expect people to do isn't always the way things end. I just keep asking myself what if the boys in the book were my children. I don't have any children, so I can't know just what I would do to hide a terrible secret. The ending surprised me a bit. </text></scrape>
