A fairly intriguing exploration of all sorts of things gone wrong in today's society. Is it morally correct to defend your children even if they commit ugly crimes?But rather than go into that, I want to use this space to beg everyone to not compare any book to Gone Girl because every comparison I have seen so far (and in this book's case, apparently the WSJ went down that road) has made no sense, and it is never clear what is meant by that. Are we to expect characters we hate? Dysfunctional marriages? Inexplicable best sellers? Fatally flawed writing? So, just like a few months ago I decided to avoid any book compared to a Franzen novel, I have now decided that any book compared to GG will not be my cup of tea, or dinner dish. </text></scrape>
