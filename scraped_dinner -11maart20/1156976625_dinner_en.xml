The immediacy of a family dinner between two brothers and their wives, with their catty and vicious maneuvering, sets us up into thinking this is just a social satire of classism and family jealousies. But then threads of the past and compelling needs to make important decisions affecting the future fate of their children casts the tapestry into darker colors, and the facades start to sag.Initially, the reader joins in on the snide thoughts of the narrator Paul toward his wealthier politician brother, such as his pathetic aristocratic pretenses of being a wine expert and shallow pleasures in the sycophantic attentions of the restaurant staff. But we are forced to back away from our comfort with Paul due to progressively more unsettling revelations. I can empathize with the fate of characters I don’t like or like characters that meet a deserving bad end, but Paul kept me at a larger distance. I guess unfolding unreliable narrators is a high art, but this demonstration of what one is willing to do for one’s family was not my cup of tea.</text></scrape>
