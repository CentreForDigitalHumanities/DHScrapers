It doesn’t proclaim itself to be anything more...and yet it is.Paul and Claire, Babette and Serge...two couples settle in for a fancy dinner at a restaurant of Serge’s choosing. Undercurrents of jealousy, impatience and rivalry are present and it’s immediately obvious that there is much more to this dinner than just food and wine. As The Dinner progresses from appetizers to desserts, certain details are explained and the reason for all the tension is revealed. What have their sons been up to? What are they all hiding? In the interest of protecting their own child, these parents will truly stop at nothing...PROS: Deliciously sarcastic, bitingly perceptive and absolutely horrifying.CONS: There is not much action to be found, and this type of slow moving analysis on human behaviour may bore some.YES or NO: It’s a MAYBE - I rated it quite highly as I’m sure it’s one I won’t forget any time soon...but I can’t say it’s one that I enjoyed. Very controversial and quite upsetting at times, but in the end it’s absolutely impossible to put down.4 Stars</text></scrape>
