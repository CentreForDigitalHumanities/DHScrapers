First, the individuals have their relationship which usually has been developed over time. It can be one of extreme fondness, respect or professional regard. Of course there are also discussions and descriptions of the menu and each item of food, which can stimulate the reader's own appetite. Then a most important factor, the conversation must be introduced. It is here that the narrative becomes more complex and often heated. Frequently, discussions devolve into chaotic territory.The author of  The Dinner  has followed this formula faithfully. I believe that to write a book involving one meal is a challenging task. Viewing it from the stance of relating a story of only a few hours can often be a boring venture. Or it can entail issues of each individual's life, which may divert the reader's attention from the group's venture. Koch started this meal at a leisurely pace, a family joining together to break bread. As the story continues, the tempo begins to change and the strands of comfort begin to deteriorate.This dinner is the meeting of two brothers and their wives. Apparently, their adolescent sons have committed an unspeakable act. It is unclear which of the parents is aware of this, but it must be confronted. So the reason for this particular dinner date is the secret . Paul, the narrator of this story has known of the malicious actions. In deliberating how to handle the issue with the others and his son, he ponders. “... I meticulously avoided looking at my son. ...I wasn't going to wink at him or show in any other way that we were sharing a secret. I wanted everything to be normal. A shared secret would have excluded Claire- his mother, my wife and that would have created a greater threat to our happy family than the entire incident...  … But what we did have to forget was the secret. And the best thing was to start forgetting as soon as possible “ (p150)The characters in this novel are not particularly likable, but their complexities are what contributes to this unusual tale. Many of their actions and activities are difficult to comprehend. Certainly it appeared that there was little fondness between the two brothers. The elder brother, Serge is a well known, charismatic politician, who is also quite impressed with himself. In many ways he is tactless and ignorant. Brother, Paul initially seemed the more likable and reasonable of the pair. As the reader discovers, behavior deteriorates badly and he joins the cast of the unlikable.An amusing point that Koch frequently addressed was the complexion of this restaurant. It was obviously one generally viewed as “upscale”. The author illustrated a point that I have often observed- the more expensive the facility is, the less food is presented to the diner. The meal may be an artistic success, but despite the international label for the food, there is little for consumption. I found much of the book uncomfortable reading due to impulsive and/or abusive behaviors. However, Koch has presented his narrative well, but I did not truly enjoy this tale. For these reasons, I could not give this book more than a 3 rating.February 29, 2016Next week my other book club will be discussing this book. It is still (Amazingly) vivid in my mind. It should be a good discussion. This group includes 4 men! The other is all women. Sometimes there is a difference in viewpoints.</text></scrape>
