And I despised the main character in this novel; pretty much from the word go I felt strongly against him, which (according to the extra content at the end of my edition) was not the intention of the author, so I take that as a failure in the book's part.It's not that I don't like novels about unlikeable or downright evil people, but there has to be something about the story that's so enjoyable that I have to stick around. The only thing I stuck around for in this novel was the mystery... and that was kind of a let down.Without going into spoilers, I would say that I found the plot a bit... wonky, and the narration relies too much in information being hidden for no other reason than the reader can't find out said information until later or the mystery can't be stretched out.Before I do go into some light spoilers, I'll just say I didn't gel with this novel, and I found it a bit tiresome and the characters a bit one-dimensional.---SPOILERS---I'm sure part of my disgust with the novel and the characters in it has to do with the current political and social climate in the world. I don't think I would've loved to read about this type of characters even without this social backdrop, but it certainly didn't help.I've seen enough of entitled, violent, bigoted, white men to last me a lifetime on the news and I've dealt with more than I'd care to on the internet, so having to be stuck in that perspective during this (albeit short) book was more than unpleasant. I would not recommend this to anyone... you want to see white men presumed innocent in crimes against actually innocent people (often of color) and have them come out happy and unscathed? Watch the news, this book won't give you anything you need to have in your brain.I powered through, but I didn't get much satisfaction from it.</text></scrape>
