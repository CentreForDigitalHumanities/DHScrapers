It's a book with a lot of things to talk about. What do you do when your child makes a horrible decision? You want to teach them and guide them but we need to let children make their own decisions in order to help them - especially as they get older. These boys are around 16 - old enough to hopefully be making better decisions but definitely still making mistakes.I was horrified by at least half of this book. I think with each new chapter, after midway, my mouth was permanently dropped open. It's just so staggering but I can easily see how this opinion is adopted. It's frightening.</text></scrape>
