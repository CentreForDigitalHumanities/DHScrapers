I figured any piece of writing that can elicit such strong emotional reactions has to be read, and my experience was certainly not disappointing. There are, as some reviewers have noted, some aspects of the story that are unlikely, to say the least, although I will avoid any spoilers here. On the other hand, I never felt that this book was tied to any absolute reality. It is a satire, sometimes cynical, sometimes shocking, of the Danish upper-middle class, their values, and their views of themselves and the world around them. So, if some events seem exaggerated, or some of the narrator's character traits seem to go too far, that's fair game as long as it serves the points that the author is trying to get across.The story of two couples (two brothers and their respective wives) having dinner together begins with the kinds of squirming discomfort we have all felt when forced to spend time in the company of family members we don't necessarily like. It goes off into a tangent, however, as we learn that each of these couples are parents to 15-year old boys who have been involved in some very violent, if not twisted, activities. The biggest problem I have is with the story's structure: just as some important things are about to be said around the dinner table, the narrator begins recounting events from the past. The stunning revelations of these previous incidents are extremely important to understanding the story, but just when we get hooked on what happened in the past, we're brought back to the dinner, where there is a lot of beating about the bush. While the tension around the table does continually mount this way, the constant flashbacks, some of which deal with incidents many years old, and go on for pages and pages, makes it feel like the author has left one story to go off and tell another. One has to resist the temptation to peek ahead to see how the other story-line is turning out.That being said, the narrator's stories as a whole are fascinating, especially as we learn many disturbing details about his own life, and the way this allows the characters of the two brothers to be developed, so how we feel about them at the beginning is pretty much reversed at the end, is unexpected and very well done. I found myself constantly pausing in my reading and asking myself how I would have handled my children in similar situations. To read a book that is both thought-provoking and entertaining, as this one was, was a treat.</text></scrape>
