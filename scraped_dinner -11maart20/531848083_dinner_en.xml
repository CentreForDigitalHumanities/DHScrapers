The plot revolves around Paul and his wife Claire having dinner at a fancy restaurant with Paul's brother Serge, a candidate for prime minister and his wife Babette. The book is divided up into the courses the couples are served. At first every thing starts out innocuous enough. Banal topics are discussed and over priced food is served and resented. As the night goes on however the conversation takes an ugly turn and it becomes clear that the families have gathered to discuss a shared family secret, let the nastiness begin!I get the Gone Girl comparisons. Gone Girl exposes the diseased underside of a seemingly perfect marriage while in this book you have two families who seem to have it all to the outside but within is some seriously corrupted DNA. Without hopefully giving too much away I would put this book with We Need to Talk About Kevin and Defending Jacob. This is a Dutch book and I loved the writing and the way the characters speak. Anyone familiar with the Millennium Trilogy will be right at home with the writing. </text></scrape>
