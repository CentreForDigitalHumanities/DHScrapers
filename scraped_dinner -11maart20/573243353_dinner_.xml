Examples:The medical diagnosis: The narrator’s disorder with the surname of a German-sounding neurologist that pops up halfway through is problematical. On the one hand, it blunts moral force (if there is any in this tale), taking away from the narrator’s agency, his responsibility for his acts and their consequences. On the other hand, it’s science fiction. Hard to imagine that a school psychologist could make such a diagnosis—of a genetic disorder that can be identified by amniocentesis. And hard to imagine what that diagnosis could be. The only thing that could possibly begin to fit might be Brunner Syndrome. But that wouldn’t be diagnosed on a routine amniocentesis, and the narrator doesn’t appear from his writing and his former history-teacher job to have a lower than average IQ (even if his wife is smarter than he is). And there’s no family history, no arson, no hypersexuality, etc. Plus it has been identified in only 14 males from one single Dutch family. So: science fiction, I think.The reason for the dinner: Implausible, being very generous, that these families would meet to discuss this serious issue concerning their sons over dinner at an up-market restaurant. And especially if the narrator’s brother, Serge, were who and what the narrator makes him out to be. When your children murder someone, you don’t go out to eat at a nice place to talk it over.The zippo lighter: Hard to imagine that a fifteen year old boy has a Zippo lighter just in case a girl asks him for a light. Maybe a Bic. And what about the boy’s fingerprints and DNA, which would be on that lighter that was left for the police to find at the scene—which was a vapor flash, not a conflagration. And the narrator had never noticed his son having the considerable paraphernalia of a Zippo: lighter fluid, wicks, flints. This just doesn’t ring true.The macaroni alla carbonara: The narrator makes it every day for his son (Michel) while his wife (Claire) spends many, many weeks in the hospital. And he never takes Michel to visit his mother. Weird at best.The beating of Michel’s principal: Acts have their consequences. But not this one. The narrator wishes he had beat the crap out of his son’s principal, but there’s nothing to indicate that ever happened.Claire’s attack on Serge: Implausible. And even if she had at him with a broken wine glass, how much damage could she have caused? And another act without consequence: Serge drops the charges and that’s that.This just doesn’t ring true.The tip: The Dutch don’t tip and they don’t have conversations about wait staff living off their tips (because they don’t). They might leave the small change, but never 10-15%. And had the narrator left a 100% tip for a vow of silence that he had been seen with his son in the garden, that would just get folks talking all the more. Pretty ridiculous, at best.The disappearance of Beau/Faso: Assuming there is such a person (which isn’t all that certain), he’s killed by the sons of the narrator and his brother, Michel and Rick. The narrator’s son, Michel, might not have a conscience eating away at him. But that isn’t the case with his brother’s son, Rick, who is already falling apart before he adds his adopted brother’s murder to his guilt. Another act that would have had consequences in a real world.The amniocentesis result: The amniocentesis result had been sitting for 15 years in an envelope in the antique chest of drawers where the narrator’s wife kept her “secrets.” Yet the narrator never looked there until the night of the dinner, when he found out that he and his son shared the bad gene. Yeah, right.Taking down the YouTube video: Well, you don’t just take down a YouTube video. Once such things are posted, they’re forever.Michel says it all to his father [159]: “Christ! When are you going to start acting normal?” The answer is never. Paul is a madman and all this is his fantasy, off or on his meds. There’s just too much that doesn’t ring true.It’s a nasty, shallow tale. Unsatisfying. Crazy. That fits the narrator, but doesn’t leave much for the reader. Perhaps had Claire (or Serge or Babette—or Michel or Rick) told the tale it would have been worth telling. Or not.</text></scrape>
