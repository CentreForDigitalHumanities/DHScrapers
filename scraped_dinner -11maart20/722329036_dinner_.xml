This is a perfect example of how hype can ruin a reading experience. I had put myself on the wishlist for this book months prior to actually receiving an e-copy from my local library. I had heard so many good things about it, even that it was being made into a movie. It has to be a good book if Hollywood has taken notice, right? WRONG. Don't buy it; if you really must read it, borrow it from your library. Terrible story that keeps bouncing back and forth between vague experiences, self-absorbed characters that you never really get to know, and a horrible offense committed by spoiled brats that get away with it all. I won't be quick to pick up another book by this author. </text></scrape>
