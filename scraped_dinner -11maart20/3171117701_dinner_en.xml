Each character was worse than other and I am not sure who is the worst. Simple conclusion, everyone in this book was bad and twisted.It was very disturbing and dark book. The book was written in the way that was easy and quick to read, however the content was difficult to take in. I also felt that maybe author tried to cover too many sensible issues we have in only one book, like mental illness, aggression, crime, problems of adults and ones of teenagers. However considering seriousness of this book, I was laughing every time the restaurant manager pointed his “pinkie” to describe the food. No I do not want to go to such restaurant, but if I am by chance, Dear Manager, please serve me this:Aperitif - glass of champagne, the best oneStarter - Beluga caviar from Russia with dill from Lithuania, crème fresh from France and blinis or foie grass from Perigord with truffle from France and finest baguetteFor main – Chicken from finest farm in the sauce with chanterelles from Lithuania.For desert - crème brulee with berries from who knows where and just best espresso from worldTo finish the review, I would like to say this book is somehow difficult to say “I recommend”, even if I liked it. I will leave to readers of this review to decide.</text></scrape>
