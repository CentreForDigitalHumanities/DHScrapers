My biggest complaint with this book is that I did not like any of the characters in the story, which makes it hard for me to care about the characters enough to be interested in what happens to them. Apart from that, I like the way this book is set up, where the entire story takes place over one night. There are flashbacks to give background information. I also like books that take place in other countries, this one takes place in the Netherlands. The book started out slow and then kept building momentum right up till the end. </text></scrape>
