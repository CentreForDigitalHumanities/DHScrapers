I don't want to say much about it, because the plot itself isn't really anything, but the story is gripping. And I can't talk about the story at all without revealing what it's about. Just read it. Suffice it to say, it has to do with economics and class relations in the Netherlands, which are directly related, IMHO, to economics and class relations in the USA.</text></scrape>
