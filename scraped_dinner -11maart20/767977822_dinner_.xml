Serge, however, can get a reservation on short notice, much to Paul’s annoyance, because (1) he knows the owner and (2) he is a candidate for prime minister. The novel begins as a nicely crafted parody of the little procedural absurdities associated with fine dining, with only the merest hints of dark events to come. Paul is appalled by the prices and is particularly irritated by the small size of the portions and by the obsequiousness of the head waiter, whom he calls “the manager.” We get to experience the extent of the waiter's pretentiousness throughout the five-course meal, during which the plot unfolds. About a third of the way into the book, we learn that Paul is Serge’s brother. After paying obeisance to Anna Karenina’s “happy families” trope, the author reveals that both Lohman families have some significant concerns about their teenage sons. At this point, I must stop to avoid spoilers. However, Paul tries mightily to preserve his “happy family.” At the end, we may be sure that if his family is happy, it belies Tolstoy’s adage that all happy families are happy in the same way, because both of these families take “dysfunctional” to a whole new dimension.Evaluation: Paul is an observant and opinionated narrator. Koch only gradually lets us discover the depth of Paul’s character through Paul’s own words. And that character turns out to be quite a bit more complex than it appears in the first few chapters. The book is short, tautly written, ironic, innovative, surprising, and very, very dark. Sam Garrett’s translation is so idiomatically accurate that it appears to have been composed in English. I highly recommend it for fans of plots that are dark and twisted with rather heinous protagonists. </text></scrape>
