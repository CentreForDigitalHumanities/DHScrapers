The reader learns about his life during an evening at dinner with his brother and his wife; an innocent dinner but with serious undertones. When they reach dessert they finally bring up the subject they have been avoiding all evening, their sons. This book deals with right & wrong, crime & punishment and how far reaching the consequences can be. It also shows how far parents will go to protect their happy family. Lots of food for thought.</text></scrape>
