Its too amazing. The main characters are monsters, everyday ordinary monsters. I think I read it open mouthed. Not a book I will forget in a hurry, in fact I think it will resonate for a long long time.I'm not telling you about the plot. Just go get it. Now. By the way its a great translation from the Dutch.</text></scrape>
