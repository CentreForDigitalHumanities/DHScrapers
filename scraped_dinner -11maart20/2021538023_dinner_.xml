It's a darkly comic story about a family hurtling towards a cataclysmic decision. In fact the cataclysm has already happened, but the narrative doesn't give this away until later. Then, after pages of meticulous character development, it lands a shocking reveal with a hefty punch. There's hints of American Psycho in here, not so much in horror but as a study in violent deviancy peppered with moments of outrageous humour. The reader is kept in a constant state of uncertainty due to the disconnect between how the protagonist sees the world, and how it actually is. Paul sees himself and his actions as rational and normal, but he is most definitely out of touch. The ending is a bit of a let down - I didn't buy the sudden outburst of violence from a central character with only a throw-away reference to a close family member to justify it. But it's a minor point in what is otherwise an excellent novel.</text></scrape>
