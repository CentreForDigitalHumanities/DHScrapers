To discuss a crime commited by their two biological sons (cousins to each other).A class piece.....in other words, the author uses food (in this case, an elite restaurant vs. the homeless woman sleeping with chicken bones in a sleeping bag) to contrast a horrific crime committed by their two sons.There is a scene in the fancy restaurant in the bathroom where the protagonist pees against some fancy waterfall urinal and a bearded stranger takes up peeing space next to him and the contrast in their virality is carried on about....OMG....never read something like this in lit before. Penis worship.It made me sick the carry on of the dishes with the ma√Ætre de's finger hovering above miniscule pieces of lettuce, or goat cheese or something equally "noveau" (SP) and just the whole pretentiousness of this dining out experience. The wasted landscape and delusions of the rich........and so far I'm only 1/2 way through.I wrote the above when 1/2 way through this book. I am now entirely through the book. More is revealed......It is a very thought provoking book about modern society. It deals with class (as in upper vs. lower class) and the way we view people and judge people. It deals with family...the concept of what a family is, blood vs. adoption.....it deals with compassion vs. reason. And how are secrets in a family good for the family. Private vs. sharing space.......Very good book for a book club I think.I am wondering though what "disease" did the father actually suffer from? Did he influence his son to turn out the way he did or was in in the genes? Was Claire equally as cold or just a mother lioness to the point of madness? Is this helicopter parenting to the extreme? What is right vs. wrong and does conscience matter anymore? Or is it expendable, depending on what you contribute to society? In other words, if you are a "money maker" or a "job creator" is that contribution to society enough and can your private morals become "your own business". I don't know but I think this is a path that the world is starting to slide down.Why was the father so violent? Again, what disease is this?Makes you think.I got that Claire made the decision by herself to have the abortion at the hospital...that I understood. I think this is an important book for today and resonates with lots of modern families (sad as that is) where basically the kids run the families and the parents are either damaged so that they can't properly parent and/or the parents are children themselves.And the bottom line here is ....the skewed moral compass of modern times....do you do the right thing or the convenient I don't want to be bothered thing (although you will pay later at some point if God in in charge). Think about that!I contrast this book with the non-fiction book called Refuse to Drown where the father "does the right thing" and turns in his biological son for a murder he committed. As opposed to these pretentious amoral people more interested in their social standing, political standing than doing what is right and moral.All in all, a totally repulsive book. made me sick.</text></scrape>
