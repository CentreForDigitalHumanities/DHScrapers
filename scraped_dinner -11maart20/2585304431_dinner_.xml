I found the characters to be unlikable, especially the main character and it didn't feel like it was getting anywhere. I also feel that most of what I read wasn't necessary to further the story. The synopsis sounded interesting, but I feel that the book had the same issues as Gone Girl and thus wasnt successful in my opinion. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.</text></scrape>
