It draws you in - you feel the main character gets you and you get him: fancy restaurants are dumb! Your politician brother is a fake! And then it goes to a place you would never suspect. It's essentially about family and the lengths we will go for it. But it's dark. Very dark. And the last few pages will leave you feeling cold and electrified, and maybe slightly nauseous.</text></scrape>
