I made it halfway through before losing interest. I found the writing to be rather tedious, and the story dragged on and on. There simply wasn't enough tension or intrigue to keep me interested, and I had no desire to continue reading in order to solve the mystery. Therefore, I gave up reading the book. I waited a long time to write my review in the hope that I would one day want to finish the book, but that never happened and I am now certain I will never finish reading it.</text></scrape>
