The beginning was very interesting but mid way through, I lost interest. I felt the suspicions were being prolonged and in the end when the truth was revealed, it wasn't anything that I wasn't already anticipating. This book definitely proves how most parents out there are willing to defend their children in a heartbeat, regardless of what wrongs they've committed.</text></scrape>
