I think it's brave for a writer to populate a novel with characters who behave so badly, as it's hard for the reader to separate dislike for the characters from dislike for the book. I struggled to make it through this book of unlikeable characters, and I could not stand the slow pace...it felt like I, too, had joined this drawn out dinner with insufferable, self-absorbed people who had lost touch with reality. It could have been a 'what would you do in the same situation?' kind of book, but in the end, the person who had the most to lose (Serge) was the most willing to do the 'right' thing. I suggested this book to my book club, so I'm hoping it wasn't too miserable a read for the rest of the group.</text></scrape>
