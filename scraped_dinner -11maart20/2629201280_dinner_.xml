On the 20th of November I had to change my mind again. This is the worst book I've read this year. Picture Gone Girl, We Need to Talk About Kevin and American Psycho - this would be the miscarriage of that love triangle. I strongly believe in the reader's right to abandon an unpleasant read, and believe me, I was extremely temped to abandon it, but the shortness of the novel made me persist and be done with it. The plot idea is quite interesting, even though not really original: two married couples have to meet up at dinner in a fancy restaurant to talk about something dramatic that has to do with their children. Over the main courses, brought to the table and described by the maitre, the narration proceeds slowly, and by page 50 the original interesting idea turns into a banal, obvious ending. Believe me, by page 50 you already get the idea where this is going to. And it's bad. I don't think the issue is the "credibility of the events": we hear the news, we are familiar with current events, these episodes are not too far from the truth. It's the way in which they're told that represents a problem. Not only the language is vile, is unrealistic, it makes you hate each and every character, but it also shows the author's complete lack of understanding of mental health issues. The way in which he portrayes mental health and its degeneration in this novel is awful. It's the depiction a child would made. It looks like a joke, a parody, but it's not the author's intent. It's cringey, it's unrealistic, it's completely detached from the reality of these events and situations. I hated this novel. I hated this with every fiber of my being. </text></scrape>
