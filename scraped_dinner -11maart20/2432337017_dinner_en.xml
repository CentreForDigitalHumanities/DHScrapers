This book was different~ when I first read the synopsis, I thought that while the story would be of a serous nature, there would be more humour throughout. I was wrong. The book was serious, but definitely not humorous. This story takes place in Amsterdam, with two couples meeting for dinner at a very posh restaurant. We know from the back cover that they will be discussing their sons. This actual discussion does not begin to take place until two-thirds of the way through the book. Leading up to that is a description of these characters and their weaknesses. All told from the point of view of the character of Paul Lohman. I really felt that Paul’s version of everything really limited the full scope of the story. Lots of mixed reviews on this book, not one I’d recommend. </text></scrape>
