The story is told from the point of view of Paul, the father. He is not likeable and he unfolds the story in a schizophrenic manner. He jumps around in the story like he has ADHD. The first 20 chapters are totally boring and can probably be skipped without losing anything.
This is an audiobook and the narrator is the best thing, he is a very talented voice actor and was able to portray all the different characters with distinct voices.</text></scrape>
