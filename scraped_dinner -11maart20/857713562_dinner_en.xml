Two couples - the narrator, his brother the Prime Minister candidate, and their wives - go out to dinner to discuss a bit of misbehavior their sons collaborated on. The candidate's other son, adopted from Burkina Faso, also plays a role. One spends the book wondering how reliable the narrator is, and whether his marriage is about to be exposed as not as sound as he makes it out to be; in the end (view spoiler)[he is reliable, although not sane, and his marriage is sound. In a Macbethish sort of way. (hide spoiler)] I wondered a bit if there was some kind of allegorical work going on here, but I don't think I care enough to think more deeply about that. I wanted a palate cleanser between big reads; this served the purpose, although it was so quick that I had to read two other books in addition.</text></scrape>
