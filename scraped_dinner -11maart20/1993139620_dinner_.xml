However, instead of eating them, we are encasing them in mama's womb until they turn 34 and "devouring" anyone who gets in the way of that. I don't know if the satire was intentional, but I do know that WAY too many parents are swimming around that side of the pool where Claire and Paul hang out. The: "My-sweetangelbaby-can-do-no-wrong, even when, ma'am, there are clearly two gigantic, demon-horns growing out of your angelbaby's head" Syndrome. What is Koch suggesting about the roles of the modern-day "mama" and "dear old Dad"? This novel should be required reading in every Sociology 101 course...And yes, Swift was using satire to call attention to a famine which has absolutely nothing at all to do with this story...or does it? Why is this titled, "The Dinner," and everyone at the table is starving or not eating throughout the entire meal? I can't help (and hope) but think this is an intentional nod to Swift, except this time the upper class is starving. But starving for what? From our highly unreliable yet, at times, insightful narrator, there was some great subtle and not so subtle commentary in these pages about the twisted mentality of the upper, privileged class in terms of race, gender and poverty. Swift and Koch's work both speak to turning a blind eye to grotesque situations and to the poor. Why and when do others look the other way in the face of human suffering...in the face of those who are, well, starving for a damn potato or just trying to conk out in an ATM booth under a pile of rags without a Zippo being thrown at them? Perhaps not much has changed from 1729 to 2009? Did I mention that the narrator was a history teacher?The dark satire and hyperbole in this novel were both cooked deliciously. I liked that, through these characters, Koch seemed to be suggesting a larger and more disturbing quality about human nature in general: "From a certain vantage point, you could see only the presence of people, not the people themselves anymore. That was when I would start to panic." Because of this, I specifically did not take Claire, Paul, and Serge literally and, if you do, please try to think of Swift's baby-eaters before you continue reading. It might help take the edge off your shock and distaste and help you digest the bigger picture behind these characters as they emerge in all their caricature-istic glory in the final pages. But perhaps we are living in an age now where most readers have developed an intolerance? allergy? sensitivity? to dark satire when it appears on their plate. Politically/morally/literally correct AT ALL TIMES is the new gluten-free diet. Are you literally evaluating these narrative events and grotesque characters at face value-still-by the time one of them mames the wannabe-oenophile's face with the stem of a broken wine glass, scarring him for life with his bougie-poser passion? I seriously hope not. The idea that this novel is somehow comparable to "Gone Girl" and that this is also being turned into a big-budget movie...it seems what is going on between the lines could be getting lost here...I wonder if I can think of any other food analogies to describe this novel...stay hungry...there may be more on the way. Ok, I'm done. READ THIS BOOK---BUT DON'T READ THIS BOOK if you thought "A Modest Proposal" was actually about eating babies or (moreover) if you were offended by it. Go read "Sweet Valley High" instead. Forever. Ok, now I'm done. Check, please.</text></scrape>
