The narrator expresses a reluctance for the evening and suggests that the reservations are at a pretentious restaurant and that he's not entirely looking forward to his brother's company for the evening. His brother is presidential candidate in the upcoming Dutch elections and there is some suggestion that he to is less than authentic. Reading the first chapter, I was lulled into thinking I was beginning a story that was going to make some poignant commentaries on family, society and perhaps politics. This continues in Chapter 2 with an analysis of happiness and the narrator quotes Tolstoy's Anna Karenina that 'All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way". The authors extension on this is that unhappiness loves company and in fact cannot get by on its own without validators. This book, however, is far more than a social commentary.The Dinner is an exploration of character and violence. The narrator tells us that just before dinner, he had found something confronting on his son's mobile phone and is deliberating about how to raise this with both his son and his wife. Suspense about the find is built and it is in fact this incident on which the plot spins towards it's terrifying conclusion. Deftly, written this book is quite different to others I've read. In the story the narrator praises thinking "through several moral dilemmas to their most extreme consequences" and certainly this is what Herman Kock does with the characters and ideas that are explored through the pages of The Dinner. He also suggests through one of the characters that "we have to accept that there are real monsters out there .... monsters who should never, under any condition, be released". As a reader you may question if Kock should have ever released his monsters to the audience of this book. It's hard to say that I enjoyed reading this book, but it was a fascinating exploration of violence and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who loves interesting characters and a story that pushes you to explore an idea to its limits..</text></scrape>
