It has haunted me ever since.While watching the evening news a middle aged couple see a recording of 2 young men flash across the screen. They are being accused of a very serious crime. The police don’t know who they are, but they are looking for them. The viewers recognize the boys immediately. The 2 boys are cousins. If you recognized one of the boys as your nephew, the other as your son, what would you do? Would you turn them in? Would you force them to confess? Would your protect them, even if you knew what they did was wrong? Would you let their promising futures be cut short as the result of one stupid act?The Dinner takes place in an upscale restaurant in Amsterdam as the parents of these two boys (the 2 men (brothers) and 2 women (their wives) meet to discuss what they should do, if anything. The tension around the table is palpable. As the evening progresses each parent offers his or her perspective on what should happen next. During their conversation there are flashbacks of the lives of each parent, each child and of the incident. “Is it life-threatening?’ they asked. They said it slightly sotto voce, but you could hear the thirst for sensation right through it – when people get a chance to come close to death without having it touch them personally, they never miss the opportunity.” A disturbing, psychological thriller, full of moral dilemmas. The Dinner addresses the issues of entitlement, passing judgement on other’s actions and what a parent might do to protect his or her child - or his or her self. It urges us to ask: do we really know one another, our spouses, our children, our selves, as well as we thought we did. “Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”</text></scrape>
