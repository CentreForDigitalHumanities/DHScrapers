I will confess that generally I want to have at least one character that I like. But it's not always necessary. If the plot or situation enthralls me in such a way that I am compelled to keep reading, then I'm happy to. This book however, I kept reading because every review that I read and every recommendation I got from friends said how fabulous this book was. I read to the end hoping it would get better. I hated it. I hated the fact that these entitled kids hurt multiple people because they thought it was fun. I hated that the parents were willing to cover it up, even when they discovered it was a pattern. I hated that the father knew he had a mental illness, that had probably been passed on to his son, but he just found it funny. I hated that the one person who wanted to come clean and do the right thing was presented as an egocentric buffoon. Maybe it isn't that I need characters that I like. Maybe it's that I want to know that there is a moral compass out there. This book was filled with psychopaths with no redeeming qualities. I absolutely cannot recommend it.</text></scrape>
