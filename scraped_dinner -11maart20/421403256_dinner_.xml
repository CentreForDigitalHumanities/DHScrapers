Watch out, everyone seemed to say. Powerful, disturbing, makes you feel sick to your stomach--like that. But not much more; after the one sentence plot summary (two brothers and their wives meet for dinner in a fancy restaurant to discuss some Very Bad Thing that their 15 year old sons did), little was said. So I was curious--even as I was nervous about subjecting myself to it--what creates that aura? What does this novel have that is so different? The answer is, a lot. Unfortunately, any good explanation of what makes it different will be a spoiler, and much of the power of the novel is in figuring out yourself what's going on as you read. So you're going to have to take my word for this. Read the book. It's not long. It's fascinating and frightening. Andâ€¦let me know what you think!But I will try to say more, if only not to be annoying. What is amazing about TD? First, the narrator, who grows from a charming, rather sarcastic but otherwise sympathetic guy who doesn't want to go out to dinner with his brother to something very different. Koch manages this transformation brilliantly, always keeping the reader guessing, but leading him/her inexorably to the novel's conclusion. He creates an unforgettable character through this voice. Second, the dilemma, and the myriad angles Koch presents with which to consider how to resolve it, and the layers of rationalization required. Third, the ominous sense that we know these families--these people we would like to find reprehensible, but who are actually more like us than we'd care to admit. And the better we understand the narrator and the dilemma, the more we want to distance ourselves. But we are not allowed to; Koch keeps it all just within the realm of our experience, and will not allow us to disown these characters. Fourth, the central question of what Koch is trying to do in this book. It's unclear, even after the last page, and the possibilities of his intent engendered a lively discussion in our book club meeting. I was surprised at the range of ways there are to view Koch's intent, and how many parallel logical and descriptive arguments he managed to introduce along the way to support these possibilities.Still not helpful to anyone who hasn't read the book. Sorry. Now go read the book.</text></scrape>
