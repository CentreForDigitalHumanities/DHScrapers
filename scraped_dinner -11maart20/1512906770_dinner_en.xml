Even more curious, is that my friend said it was about the complex psychological relationship between a father and son. But to me it was so much more about parents and children. It was about two marriages, siblings, particularly brothers. It was about the lies we tell ourselves, and truths we face. It was about (to me) pretention versus authenticity, and whether or not we know the difference and can judge the difference in others. It was about love, responsibility, beliefs, and intra family conflict. You know I hate spoilers of any kind, so I will be careful describing the plot. At the heart of it, is two couples out for a long meal, where beneath casual conversation, decisions must be made, and lines drawn, and points of view to consider. There is a 15 year old son from each couple, who are both central to, and background of the story. It is narrated by one of the fathers, whose struggle to wrestle with his point of view and that of everyone else's, mixed with his very strong subjectivities, are at the heart of the story. It was compelling and engrossing and difficult to read, and now that I think about it, could probably be classified as a tragedy, for this months tragedy theme. I have read a number of feel good books this summer, and this isn't necessarily one of them. But its engrossing good reading, psychologically complex, and I couldn't put it down. I'm late for work, so I could write the review, and I'm still thinking about it. I liked it for sure. Favorite, most interesting, and most compelling character? Hands down, the narrators wife Claire. Natural, fascinating, spunky, independent, a teeny bit petulant and a true mother. I rather think I will remember her and this book for quite a long time. </text></scrape>
