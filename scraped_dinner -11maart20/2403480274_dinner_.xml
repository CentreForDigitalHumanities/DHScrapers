I can not like characters and still like a book, but this one just didn’t do it for me. It isn’t boring so that’s something.

The premise is two brothers and their wives meet for dinner to discuss their children. Throughout the book you know the kids have gotten into some sort of trouble, but don’t know what. My question is why go to a fancy restaurant to discuss family problems?

And then it ends.</text></scrape>
