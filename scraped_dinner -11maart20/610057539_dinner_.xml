Odious! I starred listening to the audio version but the narrator did too good a job of portraying the odious nature of the main character. The hatred he has for his brother, his disdain for a certain kind of restaurant, his self importance hat I couldnt stand hearing him any longer. So I switched to the print version which wasn't much better. What disgusting people. Every one of them foul. Seriously, why would people like that meet in a restaurant to discuss something so sensitive and private? If there was any merit to this book it was probably the writing. Herman Koch was pretty effective at creating such hateful characters and scenario but I couldn't help wishing that Ian McEwan had written this book instead. </text></scrape>
