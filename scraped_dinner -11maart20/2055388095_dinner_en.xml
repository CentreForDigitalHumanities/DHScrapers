This is nothing like Gone Girl. It's more like Defending Jacob.

It's funny. I started the booking detesting one family and being sympathetic to the other, then detesting both, then finding myself really detesting the second couple, and being more sympathetic to the first.

It's interesting how perspective changes as the story unfolds.</text></scrape>
