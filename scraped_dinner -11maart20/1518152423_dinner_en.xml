I've had it on my TBR since early 2014. Five glorious stars. I guess you just need to be in the mood for it. This book begins as a dark family drama and turns into a hilarious thriller that takes place over the space of one evening, with two families at dinner in an upscale restaurant. I notice many reviews did not like this book at all. There certainly are mixed opinions. So, I find myself in the minority again. I enjoyed all of this crazy story. Poor, lovable yet unstable Paul is a riot and his character makes him an unreliable narrator; which makes me wonder how the other side of this story goes. The actual narrator does a wonderful job of exposing Paul's vulnerabilities and jealousies. I simply loved the way Paul said Serge's name. The setting is very clear and the courses are explained with great detail. I guess it is natural to hear about the courses of a dinner in a book named The Dinner. I had a lot of fun picturing the manager and all of the staff along with the different courses. it's nice to dress up and go out on the town sometimes, but this story made me remember and appreciate a good ole rib joint with platters piled high with carbs, starches and fried foods. I liked Poor Paul and his wife Claire. I also liked his brother Serge and his sister in law Babette. I have to admit I was not too crazy about the kids of either family. Although I was thoroughly entertained, this book forced me to face hard issues and unpopular or uncomfortable decisions. It made me question my own morals and insecurities. I was left with a lot more questions than answers. I hesitate to recommend it since many did not like it. </text></scrape>
