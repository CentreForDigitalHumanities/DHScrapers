It is possible that it is simply translated poorly, and that it is no fault of the original author's, but how can I know? I don't know, for instance, if it is the limitation of the author that the narrator uses such illuminating descriptions as, "But no one at the table spoke a word. Sometime people allow silences like that to fall - when they don't feel like saying the obvious." Or, when attempting to give depth to a feeling, uses bourgeois and narrow analogies. One in particular I remember. The narrator had a feeling that he missed an opportunity to do something he really wanted to do, and he described it as winding up to get a good hit on a tennis ball but missing it completely. I'm not saying these things are inherently uninteresting, but in the context of the book they certainly don't add depth that is in many places lacking.I give this book 3 stars because I do appreciate how completely pathological the narrator is. It was very difficult reading this book (the mediocre at best prose didn't help) because the narrator was so obviously cynical, unimaginative, and pretentious throughout much of it. You thought toward the beginning that he used his cynicism, as people do, to mask a kind of insecurity or vulnerability. But you find out he lives through his cynicism and that it's perhaps the symptom of a mental illness. Every character is thoroughly unlikable, and this is the best part of the book because they're somewhat convincingly still human. It allows you to contemplate aspects of human nature that you otherwise would not have the opportunity to, because characters in novels can be optimistic and flat projections of what, according to the author, makes people good people. If think the book was written in the style of an HBO miniseries. I think it would have been better if the main device the author used to keep the attention of his readers was not just a nonlinear telling of things. Told straight through, the book could have been much more interesting if the author focused more on descriptions of characters and their motivations rather than (what I imagine are) his pithy opinions about food and fame.I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to think more about how much ground the shallowness and cynicism of humankind can cover.</text></scrape>
