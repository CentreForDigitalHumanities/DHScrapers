The jumping around was annoying, I just wanted to know what happened, but that did keep me reading this book. This would be a great book club book because it offers so much for discussion. The further you get in the book you realize how horrible all of the characters are and how truly horrible the main character is revealed to be. His wife is almost more disturbing to me because of the lengths she will go to protect her child and the fact that she prefers when her husband doesn't take his medicine to control his "illness". So I didn't like the characters and felt like it took forever to get the story so I'm rating it with 2 stars because of its purpose for discussion.</text></scrape>
