The plot seemed interesting, the reviews were extremely good but the narrative pace was so slow that I felt I wasn't getting anywhere. The description of the menu in a fancy restaurant was somehow bearable, however, when one of the characters went to the bathroom I just couldn't take it anymore. I was unable to see the point of describing the process of going to the toilet in detail, together with a detailed account of other people's physical features. At that point, I decided to watch the 2017 film with Richard Gere. Much to my dismay, the film wasn't better and I DNF-ed it too. </text></scrape>
