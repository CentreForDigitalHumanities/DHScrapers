I hate to say it, but I did not enjoy this book. I rather found it boring until the very end and by that point the book had already frustrated me for wasting time reading it.I cannot give a complete failure because I was intrigued to find out what would happen. The beginning lead me to believe something would happen. I was told to continue to page 110 so I did and that is what kept me going. However, I could have skipped the next 100 pages and been just fine.I did however like the ending. It brought back some interest, but not enough to make it worth the time I spent reading and skipping pages. After a couple great reads in a row it was destined to hit a dud at some point and I did just that. Disappointed because I think this has real potential to be a stand out read. For others it was, but for me it was dull and boring until the final scene. I will not be sharing this book over our next dinner conversation for sure.</text></scrape>
