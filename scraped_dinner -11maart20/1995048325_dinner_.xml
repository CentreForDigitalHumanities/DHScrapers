I did try to differentiate my feelings on the characters from my feelings on other aspects of the book, but found it quite difficult. Every character is this book is a reprehensible human being. And while it can be difficult to connect to a book where no character has a single redeeming quality, I can still respect a book for its other merits, especially when it's unlikable characters are kind of the point. However, I had many others issues with this book that had little to do with the unforgivable characters within.What I liked: 1. This story takes place in Amsterdam. I'm going to Amsterdam later this year...which has almost nothing to do with the actual story.What I didn't like:1. The entire premise was completely unbelievable. That two couples would gather together in such a public spot to discuss something so vile just doesn't seem authentic. I guess when we finally learn the extent of Paul's mania (or whatever his issue was...I'm annoyed that we are never given a clear diagnosis) it makes a little sense that Serge would want other people around, assuming that he would be relatively safe. But still...it's a pretty silly idea.Also, the thought that Paul could go and violently beat a principal and there would be no repercussion was a head scratcher.2. The pacing was awful. There is a big chunk in the middle of this book that is all flashback. Now, these flashbacks do end up serving a purpose, demonstrating just how twisted all of these people really are. But it essentially brings the current action to a screeching halt. The couples at dinner literally don't even begin talking about the 'incident' until chapter 37...about 70 pages from the end of the book. I'm sure this is done in order to build tension, but I found myself completely bored. I also thought there were parts that were confusing because in the middle of a passage we would get thrown into a flashback and I got a little confused about the timeline.3. The writing style/translation. I'm honestly not sure if this is a problem with Koch's writing or the translation, but the writing in this is clunky and stilted. The dialogue is really bad. And there is way too much repetition in a lot of the prose. I would be interested to read a review from someone who has read both the American and Dutch versions and see what they thought.Also, I get that the author was trying to use this dinner as a metaphor and blah blah blah. But you know what? It was boring and pretentious. I truly hope that Koch just has a way of writing despicable characters because if he is anything remotely like any of his characters, that's disturbing.</text></scrape>
