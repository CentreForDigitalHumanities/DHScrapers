In the end, the outcome was somewhat interesting, but I had to push through and not give up on finishing it to be rewarded with the end result. I listened to the audiobook which may not have helped my rating. The narrator was extremely pretentious and his voice grated on me early on. I believe that is how the character of Paul was portrayed by the author, but perhaps reading it, would've softened this character flaw to the point of tolerable. I'm interested in the movie version of this which will debut this week. 2.5 stars.</text></scrape>
