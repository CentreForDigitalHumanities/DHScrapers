The venue has been chosen by the narrator's brother; Serge Lohman. Serge is a politician, a celebrity, able to conjour up a reservation at a restaurant where most people book months ahead. His wife, Babette, is beautiful and the successful couple have three children, including a son the same age as the narrator's only child and an adopted child. The narrator, Paul and his wife, Claire, have one son, Michel. At first, Paul seems a likeable and pleasant guy, humorous and intelligent. However, this is a novel in which you gradually become unsettled because all is not what it seems. Under the guise of two seemingly wealthy and happy couples, there are unresolved issues and past problems.The main premise of the book is that, during the evening, it transpires that the two sons of the couples have been involved in something terrible. As the story unfolds, often using phone messages and flashbacks to unveil the troubling family dynamics and events, we learn of what happened. The book asks difficult questions - how far would a parent go to protect their child and how far are they responsible for their behaviour? I thought this is a remarkable read, incredibly thought provoking and well written. It would be a fantastic read for a book group, with much to discuss and is a fascinating personal read, especially if you are a parent. </text></scrape>
