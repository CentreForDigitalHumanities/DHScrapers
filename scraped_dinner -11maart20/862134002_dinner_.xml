I didn't know a whole lot about it, except it was originally in Dutch. I really liked it. I thought it was delightful how the book was broken down into sections such as Apertif, Main Course, etc. Since I'm a foodie going through the motions of an expensive meal is always thrilling in a book. But what was really interesting about this novel was how skillfully Koch unravelled his story and the characters behind them. Told in the first person by Paul Lohman, the reader not only gets a play by play of every minute detail of the dinner, we are treated to the innermost workings, desires, and fantasies of someone who seems (over the course of a single meal) to become increasingly unhinged.  I'm reading Lolita right now, so unreliable narrators are on my mind. I think Paul Lohman can definitely be categorized as an unreliable narrator. This book is suspenseful but it's very subtle about the suspense. The action is fairly limited so it could almost be described as a suspenseful character study - two genres that would seem to be at odds with one another. I've seen criticisms of this book being too pretentious, I didn't get that feeling at all. True, none of the characters were overly warm or relatable, which may have hindered the impact that the author was going for - but despite that I was still interested in the characters and wanted to find out what was going to happen to them, and more importantly, who they really were. The Dinner was, in a word, delicious.In my opinion this book was robbed during the Tournament of Books, it probably shouldn't have won, but I don't think it should have been eliminated in the first round!
