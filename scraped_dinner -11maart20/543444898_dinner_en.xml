During this dinner, they discuss trivialities trying to avoid talking about the crime committed by their sons. I see this book referred to as a thriller and I would not categorize it this way. For me, it was a psychological study of how far parents are willing to go to protect their children. This is a topic that is universal in its ability to disturb. It is very easy to choose the ethical position UNTIL you love a child who commits a crime.It is also a commentary/satire on Dutch politics. Serge exemplifies the exalted political want to be. Many of the elitist mannerisms of the upper class were comical. The pretentious descriptions of the haute Dutch cuisine were great. "The lamb's-neck sweetbread has been marinated in Sardinian olive oil and is served with arugula. The sun-dried tomatoes come from Bulgaria. This is lamb's lettuce."Once you accept that Paul is an unreliable narrator, you can just go along for the ride. He will peel away the layers of the story in whatever order and with whatever lapses he chooses. These lapses in the narrative are what allows the reader to pause and wonder. At the end, you still aren't sure that you picked up all of the important clues or that you've fully understood the lines between reality and mental illness. If loose ends drive you nuts, this is not a book for you. I really enjoyed the nuanced storyline and the characters who did not behave as expected. This is a book that lingers in my subconscious. Paul, Claire and Michel try to find their equilibrium at the end of the story as Paul reflects, "You don't have to know everything about each other. Secrets didn't get in the way of happiness." Wishful thinking?Take away: "It's like a pistol in a stage play: when someone waves a pistol during the first act, you can bet your bottom dollar that someone will be shot with it before the curtain falls. That's the law of drama. The law that says no pistol must appear if no one's going to fire it."</text></scrape>
