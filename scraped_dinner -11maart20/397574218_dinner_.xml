The narrator is by turns horrid and engaging and brilliantly unreliable, the constantly shifting perspectives of the central event and those around him he offers logically and beautifully woven. I don't see why people compare it to "The Slap" - well, I sort of do, but this is much tighter (and to be honest, more rewarding to the reader - felt less stereotyped, although perhaps a Dutch reader may experience it differently; the more complex connotational aspects are likely to be opaque to me). Perhaps its most powerful aspect is the way in which one cannot help but understand where everyone is coming from... how very easy it is to shift one's attention away from the central event, how very easy it is to dismiss it as nothing particularly unusual. Sobering, nasty, funny, rewarding: I recommend it.</text></scrape>
