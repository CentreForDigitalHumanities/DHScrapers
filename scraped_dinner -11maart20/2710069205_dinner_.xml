We chose to read The Dinner by author, Herman Koch. As a group, we rated this book 1 out of 5 stars. As part of this genre this time, we also had the opportunity to watch the movie, The Dinner (the version starring Richard Gere). As a group, we agreed that the movie put certain events from the book in perspective; however, we believe the story was told from a different point of view in the movie because the characters were quite the opposite from the book in many parts. As for the book review, there was already a barrier due to the story being written in another country so some of the language used was unfamiliar. The author jumped around too much in the book making it difficult to keep track of what was happening in the present, past, what location, etc. and he also labored too long on certain topics as if he went on a tangent and did not know how to exit out of that thought. (SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!) I could say that this could be attributed to the fact that based on the movie, he was diagnosed as bipolar and suffered from mental illness which ran throughout the family (END!). It was never revealed what Paul suffered from in the book. This brings me to one of the biggest critiques BBD had regarding The Dinner. The author never delivered full disclosure of places such as the restaurant, the school where Paul worked at for fear we, the readers, might ‘try to go there’. Many of us prefer to have names of places as a sort of visualization based on the description and a point of reference if we were ever to travel there. Herman Koch also did not divulge the illness of one of the male characters nor this character’s wife’s illness which sounded pretty severe. We could not discern the point for that? It took away from the validity of these events. The second biggest critique BBD had was the intimate focus on the foods and the originations. We understand the setting took place at dinner in an upscale restaurant, but the foods were a totally irrelevant detail; and in our opinion, not very appealing for such a costly meal. Why was it so important to be so comprehensive about such things as food which had no relevance to the theme of the story, but information such as the character’s illness was not? We understood the symbolisms of the different meal courses as it paralleled to the different stages in the story, but it still lacked any real depth or breadth. We read the post chapters in the book which helped us to understand how he came up with the title and the thought process behind the storyline, but overall, BBD found this a hard book to read and finish. It was a slow beginning; it took too long to get to the climax; it focused on things that were not applicable to the main point; and it was a boring read even though it received high reviews on Amazon. </text></scrape>
