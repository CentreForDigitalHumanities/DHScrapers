Paid seventeen bucks and some change for it at my local BAM. I'd heard mixed reviews, but of the bad reviews I read, no one was able to give me a good enough reason not to buy Herman Koch's sixth novel. A friend of mine, Mike Crane (Author of GIGGLES), read THE DINNER and loved it. Mike and I have had differing opinions on several novels in the past, but I usually, at the very least, can finish books he recommends. THE DINNER was one of those books were I mostly agree with Mike. It was worth the price of admission, even though I read the entire book in two sittings, and I do not regret adding the physical copy to my bookshelves.  I normally start off my reviews with nitpicks or negative comments about the writing of a book, but I honestly could not find one thing about this novel to criticize. I sometimes find translated novels hard to read (THE GIRL IN THE DRAGON TATTOO, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, SYNDROME E), but that wasn't the case here. The prose flowed smoothly, effortlessly, and never felt stilted or off, giving me the sense that something had been lost in the conversion from the native tongue into English. In fact, this is the first translated novel I've read that feels as if the original novel had been written in English. My hat goes off to the translator. Sam Garrett has skills. The reasoning behind my rating of four stars instead of five is purely personal taste. I was impressed by how Koch managed to keep me entertained for 100+ pages wherein nothing much happens, aside from casual conversation over wine tasting and appetizers. In fact, the book doesn't really give away a single plot point until around page 150 or so. But, even then, the subject matter wasn't entirely my cup of tea. I wasn't disturbed or unsettled by the "atrocities" of which many reviewers spoke of, mainly because I remember news reports about this very thing happening either at home or abroad, a little less than a decade back. Also, I'm far too desensitized by graphic content for something as simple as the events of this book to turn my stomach. It was simply kinda "meh" to me, and I found myself saying, "Is that it? That's the "nasty" reviewers were talking about?" This is not a negative thing about the book, but, oddly enough, what I feel is a shocking epiphany concerning my own perception of what is horrific and what is not. The fact that I do not find what happens to the homeless woman in this novel to be overly disturbing means I've lost some humanity while traveling along this road of life. I rather mourn that loss.  While I didn't find any of the twists all that explosive, I did not expect the ending. That is to say, I didn't expect the tone of the ending. To explain further would be to spoilerize this review, and I don't think that's necessary here. In my opinion, Koch phones in the reveal far too early, and I had the conclusion pinned down around page 230 out of a 290 page book (the last 14 pages of this 304-page novel are interviews, discussion topics for book clubs, and an essay by the author on how he writes). This didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book, either, it simply wasn't my favorite flavor of Skittles. In summation: This is a well-written, terrifically-translated piece of fiction that is both easy to read and thought provoking. I didn't find it disturbing, whatsoever, but I'm also a jaded fuck who needs to take a hard look at himself to find out why the viscous murder of an innocent didn't strike a chord with him. Highly recommended for fans of dark fiction who like their plots loosely braided, like cornrows on white folk.</text></scrape>
