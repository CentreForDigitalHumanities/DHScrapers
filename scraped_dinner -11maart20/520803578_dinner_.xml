This book was one of the former, and it's why I hated the book itself so much. There are many comparisons to Gone Girl - OK, yes, the characters are unlikable and the narrators are unreliable. But the people in this book aren't even entertaining or charming, or even interesting. (Their crimes aren't even creative for God's sake!) They're just bad people. Still, it was interesting enough to get me to read the whole thing, so that's something. </text></scrape>
