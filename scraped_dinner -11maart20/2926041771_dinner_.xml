It felt gross to read these folks trying to justify their bad parenting, aggressive impulses and the actions of their stunted children - even low-key hints at hereditary mental illness. Fuck off, you're just entitled white supremacist men with anger issues and the daft women who support them. Maybe it's satire but it certainly felt like a waste of time reading a tediously described trope.</text></scrape>
