I finally made it through this book. I kind of hated it to be honest and it's hard to articulate just why. I think of more enjoyable, but unsettling point of the book, that other readers enjoy is how the narrator (Paul) and his wife (Claire) are slowly revealed to be these morally bankrupt, disgusting people. I did not not find Paul's nastiness about everyone and everything at the start of the novel to refreshing or funny. I felt like I saw him for who he was early on.. It was no surprise to me that at the end that he and Claire turned out to be who they were. At first I found the writing in this book pretentious and annoying to me. I'm not sure, now I've finished it whether this writing is indeed Herman Koch's style or if it was employed on purpose to convey the story and the characters along in the way Koch wanted. Either way--I am certain I will not be reading anything else from this author in the future. </text></scrape>
