This book could be a play, as it’s set in a restaurant in Amsterdam, where two couples eat one of those fancy dinners that leave you hungry. It’s separated out by course and narrated by one man. The whole point of the book is that you don’t know what’s going on and things are revealed over the course of the evening through his narration and flashbacks, so I can’t really say much about what it’s about. By the reviews, a lot of people don’t like the book because they’re offended at the content, but I enjoy disturbing literature. I would say that people who like American Psycho would like this book, or anyone who enjoys intelligent suspenseful horror movies. In fact, I see that it’s coming out as a movie in 2017, so I’ll definitely be seeing it. </text></scrape>
