The only thing good about it is the writing. While not the best, it managed to say what needed to be said without being too clunky (although it was stilted and very boring). Anyway, the setting of this book is my biggest nightmare. It is in a fancy restaurant where the waiter/manager explains EVERYTHING when it comes to food, using his pinky to point out things few inches away from touching the actual food (this is a reoccurring theme that got so damn annoying since the character could not have been talked about without his pinky being mentioned too). Anyway, they get their food and they proceed to try and one up themselves with each bite. The narrator hates how his brother is more popular, how he behaves, and basically judges everything he does. He seems to be the kind of person who would walk into a hotel room and complain that the carpet is too scratchy or the purple drapes are too purple. When I read stories I need at least one character that is a good person and has some form of a redeeming personality. This book had none. None. All the people in it are pretentious rich folks who have nothing else to do but talk about private matters in a restaurant and talk crap about food and how others do things in their life. Even their kids are pretentious and spoiled. Like I said, it would be my nightmare to be stuck in a restaurant with these people. The two women also seemed snotty and annoyed with everything. One man mentioned how he likes Scarlett Johanson and the other proceeds to think that he likes her and not the movie she is in. One of the wives hates when men call women "babes" or tell them they have "hot bodies." While that is what many women hate, it should not be too frowned upon when referring to a beautiful actress. These are the types of people who would consider every Woody Allen movie to be a masterpiece. In the end, the idea of people meeting at one place meant we'll see some good character development. Nope. None of that crap happened. I knew things from the beginning that the characters will stay annoying and self-centered the entire time and by the end I was right. It is boring, it dragged on forever (even for a 300 page book) and the characters are all assholes. There, if you choose to read this book after my review, it is up to you but spoiler alert: IT SUCKS! Thank God I only paid $2.00 bucks for this pile of excrement. P.S. (view spoiler)[why the hell would you commit a crime and not only film it but also post it online? That makes no sense and if you do, I have no sympathy or care for you or your situation (hide spoiler)]</text></scrape>
