The subject matter is disturbing, the story compelling.Two brothers and their wives meet for dinner at a posh restaurant. All know why they are there,and over the course of the dinner, the polite conversation goes from stilted politeness to impassioned defense of what they see as their only options. For each couple has a teenage son who were together involved in an unspeakable crime. As the story unfolded,I went from shock to moral outrage,back to shock, brief sympathy,then to quiet outrage. Unlike a similar book,Defending Jacob by William Landlay, there is not one character that I could identify with or find any lasting compassion for.But I was compelled to keep reading,I had to know what happened. I can well imagine that the discussion surrounding this book has been and will continue to be fascinating.A lot has been said of the moral ambiguity of the story. And life, especially as a parent, are filled with situations that can be varying shades of gray. But(in my opinion)there has to be a point at which right is right and wrong is wrong.Finding that point for some is the challenge.</text></scrape>
