One couple - a famous politician and his wife - is used to a life of wealth. The other (we don't know much about them at this point) is not. ‘What is it?’ Claire asked.‘Did you see what it says here?’My wife looked at me questioningly.‘It says: “Aperitif of the house, ten euros”.’‘Oh?’‘But that’s insane, isn’t it?’ I said. ‘The man said: “We’d like to offer you the aperitif of the house,” right? “The aperitif of the house is pink champagne.” So what are you supposed to think? You think they’re offering you the pink champagne, or am I nuts? If they offer you something, you get it, right? “Can we offer you the this-or-that of the house?” Then it doesn’t cost ten euros, it’s free!’It is clear, however, from the second couple's circuitous discussion before entering the restaurant, that this is not just an ordinary dinner. They're there to discuss something. Something important. Something big. While reading the protagonist's long, meandering descriptions of the food and the place, I wondered to myself if this novel will just end on a lame reveal. It doesn't. I was attracted to this novel because the entire story is told over the course of a single meal - aperitif, appetizer, main course, dessert, digestif. It was stylistically intriguing, but I didn't expect to be blown away by how dark it is, by how brilliant Koch was in setting up the big reveal by giving us the details in small morsels, until we choke.You know how dinners with people you don't like can be more suspenseful, more nerve-wracking, than any thriller? And we haven't even started on the secrets.</text></scrape>
