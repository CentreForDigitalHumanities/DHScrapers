As it was a self narrating style from one of the four characters I did find it irritated me & I wanted to have heard all the othet three characters points of view.Two brothers both in sibling rivalry still in their adult life! One a politiciam everyone knows the other a teacher-A teacher with a hidden personality he has had a burn out! We find out he suffers from a condition yet we are not given the facts! Or the facts surrounding his wives illness.He doesn't want to disclose this for privacy reasons! ?The two brothers meet for dinner to discuss their sons actions.A horrific murder caught on cctv & has gone viral on the net.The faces are bluury & unless you knew them you wouldn't recognise them! Each parent has in their own way kept their secret how they found out from their partner! Over dinner we find out one mother makes excuses for her son to make it a just reason why he acted as he did! She was in the way of the atm he wanted to get money out she smelt.Did this warrant throwing a chair at her head? A plant & then a jerrycan with a lighter into the atm room!? They even went back to gloat not too help filming it & advising wait for men in black llThe fly in the ointment the adopted cousin watches them commit the offence & then threatens to expose them unless they pay money!The mother plays alibi for the one son ringing from her mobile & pretending to talk to him when she has a one way discussion withe answerphone! This is the night she just tells her son to sort out Faseo "& she doesn't want to know how! Faso disappears & we the reader can only assume a second murder has been committed!The four characters are all self centred & do not react like normal parents would.They get rid of mobiles "& delete answerphone messages to cover the tracks for their son's!The one mother in the end pushes a glass into her brother in laws face to stop him carrying out his resignation from the prresidency campaign.Her only thought he was going to taint "their favourite restaurant" not advise re the murdet.I feel sorry for Faseo was he as innocent as they portrayed? Allin all murder was wiped out of their memories the dysfunctional family again back as a unit albeit not a normal healthy one </text></scrape>
