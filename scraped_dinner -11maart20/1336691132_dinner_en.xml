He's also coarse, contemptuous and highly-insecure. It is possible, at first, to believe these attitudes stem from worry for his son and the impact this assiduously deflected conversation may have on the family he so clearly cherishes. However, as the evening wears on, it becomes harder and harder for the reader to cling to that comforting perception. And this is because, as the evening wears on, Paul grows more at ease with the telling, his honesty increasing in successively horrifying degrees.You may think, as I did, well, they're Dutch. This may be some product of Dutch-ness. Distance it, displace it; make it Other. Only Koch doesn't let us get away with that. His prose is direct and intense, his narrator rational enough to take the edge off the distinctly irrational. His truths are familiar enough, connective enough, just comprehensible enough so that, in no time at all, we're caught without a psychic safety net and that's downright impressive.There was a single misstep. A psychologist makes a brief appearance in the text and manages to diagnose a fairly serious condition in a single session, which would not happen in real life (even in Holland). But you come to realize that Herman Koch isn't interested in structuring what he considers unstructurable, modifying the unmodifiable, treating the untreatable. This is the beast that is Man and his innate, species-specific psychopathology. The mere appearance of an analyst was probably a bone he threw me.There.Feel better now?No, Mr. Koch. Not really.</text></scrape>
