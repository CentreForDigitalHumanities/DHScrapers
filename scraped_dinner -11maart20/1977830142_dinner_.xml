I am amazed at your development of characters, especially the way you can twist my perception of what's going on with them and the plot. Let's start off by saying that no one in this story is a good person - maybe Serge but that's only when I look for a silver lining in the book. Everything is written from Paul's perspective, so I fell quickly into step with his reasoning, because who  doesn't  immediately trust the character telling the story? Just me? It's very hard to write a review about this book because even little tidbits can turn into spoilers. I can say that the two couples eat dinner in a very fancy restaurant because it's clearly stated in the title. If someone would have told me before reading this novel that I would despise every character in this book, I wouldn't have believed them - I would have thought that they just didn't put themselves in the shoes of the characters to really empathize with them. However, no one told me so I was blindsided by the fact that these people are horrible human beings. I feel like a horrible person because I couldn't stop reading. Nothing that came up in the story surprised me. I love this author! I need to fill my shelves with more of his titles.</text></scrape>
