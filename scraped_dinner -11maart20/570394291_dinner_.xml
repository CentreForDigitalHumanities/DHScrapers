Paul and Serge are brothers; Claire and Babette are their wives.Over the course of the long meal Paul, an unreliable and uncooperative narrator if there ever were one, gradually reveals the purpose of their meeting. The two couples' 15-year-old sons were involved in a terrible act. What is to be done? The stakes are high. Several lives and a the political direction of their nation hang in the balance of what is decided between the appetizer and the dessert.Not all of the action takes place in the confines of the restaurant. There are frequent and extended flashbacks as seen through Paul's eyes.By the time we learn the details of the incident that led to this meeting, we already know there are monsters lurking in these allegorical woods, but the horror in the story comes from the realization that there might be more than one monster--those woods may be full of them.In addition to a commentary on depravity and self-delusion, Koch's work is an interesting exploration of sibling rivalry. One of the brothers is successful and famous while the other, we learn, doesn't have a job.Dutch readers, Peruvians and Americans from my native state of Alabama will immediately think of a sensational real-life monster story that I'm certain Koch had in mind when he wrote The Dinner. I'm confident that sensational story was a source of inspiration to him. Other readers may not make that connection, but the capacity for inhumanity and self-delusion are universal traits anyone can understand.Yes, the story is over-the-top at times, particularly at the end where it heads off into a barely believable direction; but this is a frightening book, a monster story, precisely because it rings so true.</text></scrape>
