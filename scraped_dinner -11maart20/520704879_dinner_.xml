The Dinner takes place over one single meal in which two brothers and their wives must decide how to deal with a horrific crime their children committed. Read this on vacation and was completely captivated from start to finish. Highly recommended if you are looking for a fast-paced story teeming with moral ambiguity.</text></scrape>
