Perhaps something gets lost in translation, but I found the writing artless, and the characters wooden and unappealing. I've not read Gone Girl, but Flynn's Sharp Objects and Dark Places are far superior to The Dinner. You want dark? Flynn will grab you and show you darkness...and make you watch. The best Koch manages here is a light gray.</text></scrape>
