You have an extremely unreliable narrator who becomes more and more messed up as the story progresses. We have three parents who want to cover up their children's psychopathic behavior and one parent who does want to make things right but is his motive selfish or altruistic? This story also suggest that there is a 'bad gene' that can be detected during the pregnancy and then the pregnancy can be terminated to prevent the psychopath from being born. The restaurant is a strange place to have this conversation. You would think the parents would have chosen to find a more secluded spot. The menu was not very appetizing. These are really violent people and beyond dysfunctional family.Here's the formal review:Genre: fictionAwards: Publieksprijs Prize in 2009My Copy: kindle, overdriveMy Rating: 2 starsWhy: F2FThis book is the 6th book written by author and actor, Herman Koch a Dutch author and television writer, it was translated by Sam Garrett. It is compared to Gone Girl and like Gone Girl it is dark. It is the story of two brothers and their families and is told by Paul Lohman, an increasingly unreliable narrator. They meet in a restaurant to discuss their son’s behaviors and what to do about them. The story is told around a five course meal and the book is divided into chapter headings; aperitif, appetizer, main course, dessert and digestif.The characters are middle to upper class people with adolescent children. The narrator is a former teacher on leave from his job for mental health reasons and his brother is a politician running for prime minister. The teacher has one son, age 15. The parents have not been strict in fact they have been very liberal and purposely do not inject themselves into their son’s life. The politician has one biological son and an African adopted son. The narrator and his wife have become aware of some pretty horrendous behavior and have chosen to not get involved and hope it passes over. The author is presenting parents of affluence and what lengths they will go to for their children. Because everything is told through the unreliable narrator we only know the other characters from the narrator's perspective. None of the characters are likeable because the narrator really doesn’t like them except his wife and son and there are other reasons to not like them.The main theme is what should a parent do if they be become aware of something about their child that is potentially life destroying. I think the author might be making a social commentary of the state of parenting and social responsibility. The theme is contemporary but probably is not new, just the setting in age of cellphones. The author also implies that there is a genetic problem for the narrator that has resulted in the narrator’s inability to function as a teacher and that he may have passed this on to his son. I felt this was a poor addition to the book, not well supported and poorly developed. I am unaware of any genetic testing that would tell parents that their son will be sociopath and should be aborted. The story was compelling. I did want to keep reading to find out what would happen. The events are slowly revealed through the course of the night as they are dining in this high end restaurant though there are pre dinner, after dinner and flashbacks so the time period is more than the dinner. I felt there were too many topics introduced that were never fully developed and information kept back that should have been developed more. This may have been a device to demonstrate paranoia of the narrator but it made the story a little lacking for the reader’s curiosity. There is suspense because the reader just never knows what is going on because you know that this narrator is not to be trusted. The tension is the created by the buildup of ever increasing violence. The style is the 5 course restaurant menu and the unreliable narrator. The setting is in a restaurant and Netherlands. The restaurant is not a very realistic setting that parents would meet to discuss their children’s behaviors that they do not want made public, though it is manipulated by the politician who does like a lot of publicity. The characters all display rather bad public behavior in this setting. I gave it 2 stars only but probably it is 2.5 to 3 stars. I just felt it could have been developed more. I think it will make a pretty good discussion for book club. </text></scrape>
