You either love it or you hate it. I fell in the latter, I did not like this book. At all. I did not like the characters, the plot, the conflict. The Dinner focuses on just that- one dinner with two couples. Both couples have a 15 year old son and we find out what these two boys did that proceeded this dinner. I thought the actions of everyone involved was gross, the writing was forced, the whole premise dark and twisted. This book was just not for me.</text></scrape>
