Whoever said this book was like a European Gone Girl was deluded. I could see the twists coming almost from the beginning and the only thing I was kind of surprised by was fact that story was moving so slowly. The language seemed a little off too, but that was probably due to the translation. Every now and then I break my rule about never reading contemporary fiction that's been translated into English, but nearly every time I am reminded why I have that rule in the first place. </text></scrape>
