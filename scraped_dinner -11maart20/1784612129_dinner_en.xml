If it’s true, and if the narrator’s family is an example of a happy family, then every “happy” person on the planet needs therapy. Because I’m pretty sure every member of this family are completely psychotic. Geez.There were no good people in this story. No heroes. Heck, I didn’t even consider any of the characters likable. I’ve read books with horrible villains who had more redeeming qualities and who were more sympathetic than any member of the cast of characters in Koch’s novel. They were just, every one of them, basically horrible people. Not to mention certifiably insane.If I had been actually reading this book instead of listening to it, I seriously doubt that I would have made it through the first chapter or two. It’s just not my kind of story. But I chose this as my audiobook for the past two weeks. (Side note: I live in the middle of nowhere, and I need something to listen to whenever I have to drive forty-five minutes to get to anywhere with people and groceries and the other perks of civilization.) Clive Mantle, the narrator, did a fabulous job. I didn’t care about the characters in the story, but I loved listening to Mantle read. He was perfection.So, yeah, that’s my view on the story. I would have hated it if Mantle hadn’t read it. My three stars are pretty much just for his voice. I can’t say I’d recommend it to anyone.</text></scrape>
