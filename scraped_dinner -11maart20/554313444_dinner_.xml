But then I realized that my reaction was to the story, and not the skill of the writer. Stop here if you haven't read it yet, but want to read it! As a human being, who wants to believe that the good guys always win, I hated how this ended. As a realist, recognizing that there are other human beings in the world who really could be the characters in this book, I hated how this ended. But that is not Howard Koch's fault. He actually did a wonderful job telling this story. I started the book with the assumption that our narrator was a good guy and his brother, an elitist pig. Mr. Koch did a magnificent job of making me view the world, and the people in it, as Paul does. Then ever so slowly, as if doing a strip tease of his brain, we start to see the real Paul and our view of the other characters shifts. Sometimes a book is good simply because it is good. We read it, we are entertained, we move on. This isn't one of those books. This book stays with you for a bit. You wonder about it, perhaps like me, you find yourself doing google searches about what could psychological illness could show up on an amniocentesis. You read other reviews to determine if your theory aligns with what others thought. </text></scrape>
