I recommended it to everyone I knew even before I was halfway done. Sometimes, you just know.The Dinner is a well-written, well-developed, sharp, and fascinating read. It's a quick-paced and gripping story of one dinner between two couples. It does jump in time line to other events but never leaves the reader confused or lost.That's not to say that Herman Koch spoon-feeds the plot or the story's intricacies to the reader. He respects his audience's intelligence. He at times, flirts with the actual subject but gives enough tasty morsels that you should follow along well enough if you're paying attention.I am so excited by this author and can not recommend this book enough. Please go read it now!</text></scrape>
