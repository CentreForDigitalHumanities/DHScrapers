All is not what it seems however and, as the dinner progresses we see the narrator is not entirely what we thought, first through hints, then disturbing flashbacks and seeming digressions that actually tell us more about the situation unfolding and it's origins. It's no spoiler to say that during the course of the meal secrets come tumbling out about the actions of the two couples's children but what is almost more disturbing is the way the parents react. Overall, an engrossing read.I would have given it four stars but, as other reviewers have mentioned, Koch seems to leave out or gloss over details of the characters' lives and motivations. The dialogue is a bit stilted at times, almost over stylised. But that could be a result of the translation. </text></scrape>
