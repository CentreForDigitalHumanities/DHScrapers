Both are about parents dealing with the (alleged) criminal acts of their sons and the moral dilemma posed by the question: How far would you go to defend your child? I preferred Defending Jacob mainly because I felt that it was more subtle. In The Dinner, the "bad guys" are much more clearly cut and there isn't as much mystery surrounding the crime itself. What makes this book especially interesting is that it is an excellent example of the literary technique known as the "unreliable narrator." As readers, we usually assume that the narrator is reliable and that everything he or she says is the truth, or close to it. I started out this book the same way, but gradually it dawned on me that the main character/narrator was...well, I don't want to give away the basic premise of the book, so I'll say no more.I read this in English translation (the original is in Dutch) and thought that it was an effective and smooth one. The book is only 292 pages long, which might partly account for its lack of subtlety: the author had to reveal his plot points rather quickly. </text></scrape>
