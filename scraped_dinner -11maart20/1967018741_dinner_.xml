I picked it up because I saw a trailer for a movie based on the book and it sounded interesting. And this turned out to be the worst book I have read this year. I am filled with loathing for each and every character. I kept reading thinking that it would have to get better, and in fact it was worse. I think the worst part of this book is that the one person who wanted to do the right thing was present as a buffoon. No one had a moral compass. No one had any redeeming qualities. I really hope this is not the way society is going...</text></scrape>
