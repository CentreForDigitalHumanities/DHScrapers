Stop imitating, stop trying to write for the best seller list, for goodness sake please stop writing about lust driven beings, don't worry about whether your characters are likable, but rather create a real, believable and above all interesting story that gets people talking. This is what Herman Koch has attempted with his novel The Dinner and it is why I applaud him.If you want a book with enjoyable characters who you can cuddle up with in your chair as you flip your Kindle pages then please, don't add this book to your list. The Dinner is an interesting story that examines the extent that one can place blame for the crimes of another, a child, on their parents. To what extent are the parents to blame for the deeds of their children? And where is the line that is drawn for the lengths that they should go to protect them?As I said, the characters in this novel are not likable. No, they are often confusing, disconcerting, and appalling. However, this does not stop them from being quite interesting. Told in the singular setting of a fancy dinner outing between two brothers and their wives, the story is narrated through the eyes of Paul Lohman, a character who begins as one who makes us chuckle, talking about the annoying show-acting of politicians and the uppity extravagance offered by a restaurant way too high on itself, yet as we come to know Paul more we see the unsavory and duplicitous nature that lives within, altering the perceptions of the world he lays out for us at the novels start.I find this novel to be interesting in a number of ways but mostly in the way that it approaches and confronts our preconceived notions towards individuals in certain situations and the need to find the explanation, to make the excuse. It looks at mental illness without ever mentioning an illness itself. We know that Paul is "sick" and we can assume that his son has inherited this mysterious illness or disorder, but nothing is ever mentioned concretely. Do we change our view of the situation based on the illness? And then there are our preconceived ideas about what illness or disorder he must have. Nothing is ever offered to show preference to one or the next, yet the reader assigns (and perhaps reassigns) a disorder that, for them, fits the bill. What does that say of us and our perception of individuals with disorders?This however was is where I find a fault in the book. Making Paul's unsettling characteristics the products of a biological imbalance, of whatever nature, take away from the shock of one having these thoughts, these impulses. We can explain them away, he has a disorder, and while it doesn't make it okay, it dulls the blow. To counter this however, I find that Koch's use of Paul's wife Claire expert. She is the true underrated star of the novel. Here we are met with an individual who, to the best of our knowledge, does not have a disorder and is making these decisions and her actions based on her own set of morality in the given situation. There is nothing that can be used to explain away Claire's willing involvement and participating in these events. Yet for all of the good and intriguing aspects of Koch's novel, I find that, on the whole, it falls flat. While he places his reveals at appropriate times to keep you reading, like the dinner he describes in the novel itself, it is lacking substance to make it truly satisfying. </text></scrape>
