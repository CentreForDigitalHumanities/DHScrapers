You’ve been warned.Do sociopaths know that they are sociopathic? Maybe some are like the TV show “Dexter” (a show I have sadly never seen except in bits and pieces, mainly because my wife hates stuff like that, so I can usually only catch glimpses of it when she leaves the room), a serial killer who is aware that he has a problem and compensates for it by helping the police find other serial killers (and also hunts them and kills them, of course). Maybe some sociopaths lead relatively normal lives, always having to analyze and monitor their own behavior, but never giving in to their anti-social and violent impulses.Maybe some are completely unaware of their sociopathic tendencies. Or, even worse, maybe they are completely aware of them but see nothing wrong with them. They see themselves as normal, while everyone around them as soft-hearted pacifistic simpletons. In their mind, it’s perfectly acceptable and even necessary to verbally berate one’s secretary for forgetting to mention that 10 o’clock meeting, or to beat the crap out of that guy wearing the rival football jersey, or to murder an entire family because they had the gall to post an “Obama/Biden” sign in their front lawn. In their mind, they are simply doing the world a favor.Herman Koch’s novel “The Dinner” is a horrific, wicked little book that starts out pleasant enough. Indeed, the entire novel takes place during a dinner at a restaurant. Two couples---brothers and their respective wives---have made reservations at a posh new five-star establishment. Things start out alright. They enjoy a few cocktails, make small talk.Gradually, though, over the course of the meal, things start to turn. The conversation gets ugly. Past resentments are hinted at. Something nasty is rising to the surface, something that no one wants to address and that is being talked around. Something about their children. Flashbacks paint a slightly distorted picture of an incident that occurred months before. Drunken teenagers. An ATM security camera. An accidental (maybe) death of a homeless person.How all of this coheres into a comprehensible whole is one of the joys of “The Dinner”, although the word “joy” should, by all rights, never enter into a review of this book. “Disturbing attraction” would probably be a better descriptor, or even “horrific fascination”, but never “joy”. This book would only provide joy to fellow sociopaths.Despite how disturbing the book is, there is also some humor, which is its saving grace. Granted, it’s a dark humor, the kind that makes one uncomfortable with every laugh, but it’s there. Perhaps that’s why Koch’s novel has been compared to Gillian Flynn’s “Gone Girl”. Both are rather caustic satires of upper-middle class suburban life, both have a nasty little mean streak running through the book, and both have that “I-didn’t-see-that-coming” plot twist at the end. All of these should sufficiently piss off enough readers, which is why I would love to see this book being discussed at a book club. Holy shit...</text></scrape>
