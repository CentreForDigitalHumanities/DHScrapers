It has been months since the crime. The discription the younger brother, Paul, gives of what the two boys did the night of the crime was graphic and extremely disturbing. This story’s characters lack a moral compass and exhibit not as much of a moral struggle as I would expect. The only ones who struggled with the situation at all were the older brother, Serge, and his wife but even they were disappointing. Disturbing, unlikeable characters and lack of justice for the victim made this an unsatisfying story. No inspiration, no wisdom, and no renewed belief in humanity for the reader to take away. Certainly this is not a story I want to think about long after reading it. </text></scrape>
