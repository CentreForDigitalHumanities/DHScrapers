She doesn’t really live there but she gave him that address so Kermit would think she’s a rich and famous fashion designer. The couple (Neville and Dorcas) who does live there is having a formal dinner at opposite ends of a long table when Kermit rings the bell, and they sit there for what seems like hours discussing whether to answer the door. The couple is completely unalarmed at having a pig scaling the outside of their house and a frog at their door, and Piggy eventually calls the husband (John Cleese) Jeeves so Kermit will think he’s the butler.This book is kindof like that scene except a lot less amusing. On the positive side, I did like how the narrator is slowly revealed to be *super* unreliable, and the premise of the book—two couples go to dinner to discuss an “incident” involving their sons—is interesting. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Clive Mantle and thought he did a great job. Over the course of this dinner, we eventually learn through flashbacks that this “incident” is actually a crime. And not just any old crime: their teenaged sons have beaten and murdered a homeless woman for sport and it’s captured by an ATM camera. So now these two couples have to decide what to do next, during their public fancy dinner (which is odd but plausible given the characters’ general nonchalance and lack of self-awareness). Arguments finally ensue, but not before these couples spend 3/4 of the book talking around their problem and generally being as unbothered that their sons are murderers as Neville and Dorcas were about a talking pig scaling their multistory home. Mostly I seem to have lost all patience for rich-people problems in my entertainment (and in real life, if I’m being honest). This interminable dinner is at a restaurant where reservations are backed up for three months and you might get a thimble full of each course on a mostly empty plate, where the waiter announces what he’s just served you by pointing with his pinky finger. Yawn. I thought there might be an ending that could’ve redeemed The Dinner but it fell short for me. I did get a lot of practice making ugly faces at my car stereo, so it wasn’t all for naught.</text></scrape>
