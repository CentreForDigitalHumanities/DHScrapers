I wanted to have dinner at an upscale restaurant. As a parent of 4, this rarely happens. So I was romanticized by the details of the food, beverages, and decor.The story is divided by courses of a meal. During the aperitif and appetizer, you are introduced to the main characters, all pretentious sociopaths. It is during the main course, that the reader learns they are having dinner to discuss serious events that both their sons, cousins, participated in.I had lost interest by the digestif and wanted someone to vomit their dessert all over Paul. ****SPOILER ALERT****Paul's character was unbelievable and contradicting! First of all, how could someone with so many issues dote on his wife? The way he worshiped Claire was cheesy.</text></scrape>
