Perhaps you know the kind of restaurant I mean.. the kind where pretentious people gather... mainly to see and be seen. This is the type of restaurant in which the staff is instructed to inform the diners about from what part of the world each and every morsel they put into their mouths comes; and of course, if you happen to enjoy feasting on meat, you may also discover what the meat you are about to eat dined on before appearing on your dinner plate.The story centers around two couples.. the Lohman brothers and their wives.... Serge and his wife, Babette and Paul and his wife, Claire. Serge Lohman is a candidate for Prime Minister and brother, Paul is an unemployed teacher. The reason for his unemployment has to do with an incident involving the school's headmaster (and Paul's boss) and an uncontrollable fit of rage that Paul experienced in which he severely beat the headmaster, consequently losing his job. As a matter of fact, Paul frequently experiences uncontrollable rage and engages in terrible acts of violence (and this fact figures into the storyline in a very big way). It's never fully explained but apparently Paul suffers from a hereditary disease which leaves him unable to control his anger. Oh.. and did I mention that Paul is the narrator of of this story and what an unreliable narrator he turns out to be!!The couples are meeting for dinner to discuss and incident involving their sons.... Serge's and Babette's son, Rick and Paul's and Claire's son, Michel. Dinner starts off pleasantly enough, with the usual small talk which is often exchanged in social situations. With each course (and there are many), the conversation and the participants' manners seem to deteriorate. Finally, the reader is allowed 'in on' the knowledge of just what the 'incident' involving the family's teenaged sons actually is... and it's a shocking one! I'll only say that the 'incident' is actually a shocking crime involving a homeless woman who had taken shelter in the lobby of a bank. Rick and Michel had also captured evidence of their crime on a cell phone, inserting a whole other degree of difficulty to the decision that needed to be made. By the time dessert has been served, it is apparent that these couples are in total disagreement over what is to be done to deal with the situation they are all facing.... and the true viciousness that has always been right beneath the surface throughout the dinner has been exposed. It's difficult to write a review for this book as revealing too much will spoil the shocking moments that occur. I will just say that the ending of the story is as shocking and horrific as the crime which the teens perpetrated. The characters (or lack of ) of these individuals are revealed ... at least, as told by this very unreliable narrator, Paul Lohman. The question that this very dark story leaves you with is one that has been asked many times... how far would YOU go to protect the ones you love? And although most people may say that they would do almost anything and perhaps they believe they would, this family takes that 'anything' answer to levels that you would probably never imagine. It is difficult to rate this book... the characters are unlikable and lack any compassion or conscience. On one hand, the story is well-written and Mr.Koch does a fantastic job of using Paul as an unreliable narrator. On the other hand, it is difficult (okay.. nearly impossible) for me to separate my personal feelings of loathing toward these characters enough to really appreciate how well-written this book is. This really IS a well-written, very dark story which seems to expose not only the pretentiousness and amorality of these characters; but also their grandiose sense of entitlement which allows them to believe that their privilege makes their lives and the lives of their sociopathic children worth more than a homeless woman seeking shelter in a bank lobby on a cold night.I'll give this book 2.5 stars.</text></scrape>
