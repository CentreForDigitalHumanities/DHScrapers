Apart from a bare bones story line, the book and the Italian film are as different as can be and almost view and read like two separate things. Ages, names, countries, occupations, dialogues, places and the ending have all been changed in the film - I have never seen a film diverge from the original book such as this.At any rate, it was a bit far fetched, the lack of horror that the parents felt at what their children did seems a bit unreal. Who wants to be the parent of a sociopathic sadistic murderer ?</text></scrape>
