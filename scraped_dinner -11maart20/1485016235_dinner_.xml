All you want them to is shut up. The narrator is trying to convince you to hate his brother, meanwhile he is the one you really can't stand. I was really hoping the end would reveal that the narrator was talking to a doctor in a psychiatric ward the entire novel. A better title to this book would have been: Psycho-The Holland edition.</text></scrape>
