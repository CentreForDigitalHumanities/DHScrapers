Then I decided to look up what disorder Paul supposedly had, that was passed to his son, that can be found though testing while pregnant, that can be treated with pills. And now my view on it has changed completely. I won't get into it, you can find it really easily with a simple Google search. I am not a fan of lazy research or, in this case, no research and just writing what you want even if it's completely off base. If you're going to write about a disorder do your damn research and not just write whatever the heck you want.</text></scrape>
