It was recommended to me by a fellow book clubber so I downloaded it to my Kindle without really reading anything about it. I avoided reading other reviews so I wouldn't catch any spoilers and for that reason, I couldn't put it down. I was eager to read what was going to happen next and how the book was going to end. So why only 2 stars? I hated the characters. I actually found Serge to be the most bearable by the end of the book. I liked the setting for the story but didn't like how the story kept going off on a tangent even though on reflection it was to show the instability of a certain character (don't want to give too many spoilers.) I didn't think the actions of the characters were all that plausible. I have two daughters and would definitely not react the same if they commited such an atrocious crime. So yeah.... meh..... a page turner but lacking in a certain something.Give it a go but don't invest in a copy, go borrow a copy.</text></scrape>
