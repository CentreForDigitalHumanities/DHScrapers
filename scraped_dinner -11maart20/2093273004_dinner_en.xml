In some respects it could be viewed as being provocative, voyeuristic and dark; in other ways it could be seen as being unpleasant and incredibly dull.I, for instance, love the movie Lost in Translation and consider it to be a masterpiece. My wife, on the other hand, finds it ponderous and aimless. As an inveterate people watcher, I love witnessing families having bust-ups in restaurants and other public places, as long as I'm not anywhere near them. I also watch cringeworthy social gaffes on TV through my fingers, all the while groaning with embarrassment, yet continuing to gawp.So, if (like me) you love to eavesdrop while fragile relationships unravel in restaurants, then this might be your thing. If you prefer your main characters to all be agreeable and charming, then this definitely won't suit!</text></scrape>
