It didn't seem darkly comic or a satire - just felt vaguely disturbed when I closed the cover. I'd like to see it as a movie so maybe it wouldn't be so much internal monologue of the main character. It kinda reminded me of American Psycho after a while -- in how commonplace/normal the violence was considered. Not sure what the hype was all about.</text></scrape>
