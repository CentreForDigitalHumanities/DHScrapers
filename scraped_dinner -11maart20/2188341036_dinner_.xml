It is so promising until you realize that all the characters are legitimately awful people. I was really hoping but the end of the book they would all get hit by trucks so these scumbags wouldn't be wandering the Earth by the end (spoiler alert: that doesn't happen).

Awful. Would give it 0 stars if I could.</text></scrape>
