It is about the darkest thoughts that occupy the self’s inner monologue, the very notions that force us to question the nature of the human condition, the moral bankruptcy of the family at its center. Koch builds tension masterfully through a combination of thoroughly dislikable characters, dark secrets, and a distinctly unreliable narrator. The family at the heart of the novel is quite rotten to the core. Koch’s prose is snarky and biting, the wit is cruel and unsettling. The power of his words comes through in what he does not explicitly say, the ending in which we are left to draw our own conclusions. The narrator, Paul Lohman, waxes poetic about his urges to commit senseless violence against his fellow man. But he also muses on the subject of his family: his utter contempt for his older brother; his love for his wife and child; his dislike of the adoptive nephew; his curiosity about the inner workings of his sister-in-law’s marriage. What starts out as a fairly rational explanation of the facts warps into the intimate madness of his mind. Paul Lohman is a vile man with a shaky grip on reality and morality. The Dinner is a slow burn, a gradual unraveling. The tale is deeply unsettling, displaying a disturbing apathy and often blatant disregard for those outside of Paul Lohman‘s inner circle and seemingly limited capacity for care outside of himself, his wife and his child, Michel. This novel will stick in my mind for the weeks to come, I am sure. </text></scrape>
