We soon learn that Serge is about to run for prime minister, and Paul, his brother, has a dark past. Oh yes, and the children. The four adults are there specifically to talk about their teenage sons and what needs to be done to fix this problem, but in the meantime, first there's the appetizers and a discussion about Woody Allen movies. By the time we get to the main course, all kinds of dark secrets have been revealed. But it doesn't stop there, oh no. The storytelling here is twisting and deliberate, with each chunk of the past revealed in a way that unsettles you. This is a controversial novel about well-to-do, highly unlikable people whose lives have been speckled in violence and self-preservation. I could not put it down. </text></scrape>
