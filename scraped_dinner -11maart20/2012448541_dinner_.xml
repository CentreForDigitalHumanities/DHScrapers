Recent reviews about the upcoming movie left me concerned, but as movie and book quality are not always linked, I still went into this one with high hopes. Sadly, I hated it. The narrator, Paul, his wife Claire and son Michel are sociopaths with no sense of guilt for committing violent and in two cases murderous acts. A mystery hereditary condition is supposed to contribute to Paul and Michel's actions. For Claire, she just seems to like them that way. What makes it worse is that the only ones who suffer any lasting consequences are Serge, who loses his looks and career, and Beau, who we are left to assume is murdered by Michel and Rick to cover up their initial killing. Paul and his family seem to be left to continue on and harm others in the future. </text></scrape>
