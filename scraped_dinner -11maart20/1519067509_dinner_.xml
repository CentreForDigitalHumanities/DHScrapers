The narration was all over the place. I realize the author was using the style to show us how the narrator was thinking, but it ended up being irritating. It IS a good book club, though, as it brings up a lot of issues for discussion. It just barely touches on many of them, though, like racism, abortion, selective abortion, homelessness, etc. Most of them are brought up for only a few paragraphs. It's almost like the author had a list of talking points he had to get through in a short amount of time. I imagine it's like reading a book with ADHD. Did we really need the random two pages on about using a urinal next to a man whose urine stream is stronger? Also, the main character is not likable. Now that I think about it, NONE of the characters are likable. The narrator doesn't like anything and is constantly criticizing. Except his wife, and even she seems to irritate him.Anyway, I'm sure many people would like the book. I'm just not one of them. I read books for entertainment value, not to have deep philosophical discussions. </text></scrape>
