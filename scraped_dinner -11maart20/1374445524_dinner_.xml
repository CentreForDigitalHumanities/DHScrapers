I can see that a literal, linear reading of this text would make it tedious and off-putting...but I was in the mood for leaps of the kind of logic that makes sense only in theory, not practice. The novel is a simmering pot of social criticism once you frame everything in it as ironic and exaggerated. For instance one thing that some reviewers found off-putting was the visit to the psychologist/diagnosis if neurological defect in the 'protagonist' about halfway through--but this can also be read as an indictment of the way moral choices have morphed into pathology, and/or the way any violent act these days coming from a seemingly "normal" person leads instantly to diagnostic opining in the next day's news. The novel unsettled me. It made me think far more about culpability than the more popular novel about family dynamics run amuck--We Need to Talk About Kevin. </text></scrape>
