But, more than likely, you love and hate them.Family is what this whole book is constructed around. One dinner, four people, two sets of parents all talking about something their kids have gotten into. And, honestly, that's it. Some backstory to explain different things or give more characterization to the people, but that's really the whole book. While it sounds boring, it was anything but. Yes, the characters are unreliable, but not really. All in all, I liked everyone even if I didn't agree with some of the things they did. They were real people, and real parents taking different sides of one situation and how to handle it.Reading it, I was laughing at different parts and growing anxious at others. This book completely hooked me in once I got it. More importantly, I could honestly see the motives of all the other characters in it with their solutions to the situation.I wouldn't say that this is like Gone Girl as so many other people have compared it to. There are a few common themes this shares with the book -- unreliable narrator, questionable morals, messed up family -- but Gone Girl is about an incredibly fucked up marriage and this is about parenting. Completely different planes, although they do tend to intersect quite often.Another review I read compared this to American Psycho. Having read that book a few times, there is no way to compare it. There was no violent descriptions of murder that sickened me. That book set my bar high for what grosses me out in books, so, really, this wasn't going to freak me out. And, the dull points of explanation had something to do with the plot. No rambling on about Hip to be Square in this book. Everything came back around in The Dinner, even if it didn't seem it would.This was a very good book, and I plan on reading some of his other books. If they're as tightly written and on point as this was, then it's a sure bet I'll enjoy more of his work.</text></scrape>
