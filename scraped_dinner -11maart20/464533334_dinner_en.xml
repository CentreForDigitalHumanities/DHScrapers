It has a simple premise: two brothers and their wives meet for dinner at a prestigious restaurant, and the story - which hones in on the importance of family ties and the repercussions of a violent act carried out by the sons of both couples - unfolds over the course of the evening. The narrator is Paul, whose bitterness towards his brother Serge, a successful politician, is apparent from the beginning. As the events that have led to the dinner (which is something of a crisis summit for the family) are slowly revealed, through conversation and various flashbacks, it becomes clear that many secrets are being kept.It's always tricky to criticise a book when you're not reading it in the original language, but I can't deny that the odd, stilted tone of The Dinner was a major reason I didn't enjoy it more. I can only guess at how much this has to do with how it was actually written originally, and how much is down to the translator's work. That's not the only problem with it, however: the format is also restrictive and results in a lot of boring descriptions of food and etiquette. I was mildly gripped by the mystery at the book's centre and did want to know what had really happened, but I wasn't exactly desperate to read on, and I found both shifty Paul and priggish Serge hard to like.Don't get me wrong, The Dinner isn't awful. I can understand why the basic premise would appeal to a lot of readers, and maybe it didn't get me thinking as much as it might have because I don't have/want children and therefore didn't get sucked into the whole 'how far would you go to protect your family' debate. I like it well enough when I was reading it, but since then I've come to realise it was, for me, a rather forgettable story. It would make quite a good film if it was cast and directed properly - in fact, it would probably be better as a film than a book.</text></scrape>
