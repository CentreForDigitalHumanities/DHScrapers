Two books about sociopaths in the family, but Landay's book is so much better, playing with your emotions, keeping you guessing. At various places in the book you had empathy with most of the characters. In this book you can just hate everybody. Paul Lohman and his wife, Claire, are meeting Paul's brother, Serge, whom many believe will be the Netherlands' next prime minister, for dinner, along with Serge's wife, Babette. Paul is our narrator, and while it seems like he could be quite unreliable, unfortunately, he doesn't appear to be. As they move from aperitif through to dessert the story of a horrific incident involving their 15-year-old sons is revealed, along with a lot of dirty linen. And I don't use the term "horrific" lightly. As in Defending Jacob, the reader must consider how far a parent will/should go to protect their child. But Koch's story is unrelentingly damning. I also didn't particularly care for the writing. Certain things seemed out of place chronologically, although when I went back to check, it was ambiguous. But more importantly I didn't find the story believable. It seems impossible that some of the things we learn about these characters wouldn't have driven them far apart a long time ago. It would be hard to imagine a leading politician maintaining ties to this brother. It's harder to believe a wife would not become a victim in these circumstances rather than someone who seems to prefer her husband's proclivities. It is an interesting send up of super high-end restaurants where portion size is in inverse proportion to price, and waiters and managers bring superciliousness to a whole new level. But still, I did not like this story. </text></scrape>
