This book did not live up to my expectations. I found the writing style quite annoying, especially when the author started leaving out key details. The author admits as such with some lame excuse, but it ends up feeling like he just didn't want to work hard enough to make the story make sense. Not to mention that the very premise - discussing highly confidential and illegal information in the middle of a crowded restaurant - makes this an absurd story. Bummer.</text></scrape>
