It's a story that starts off full of mystery and depth but slowly condenses into a cumbersome pile of garbage. The narrator is an insufferable twat devoid of human compassion and because this book is in first-person, anyone hoping to slog through all 318 pages of his contemptuous, pain-inducing narration needs hold their nose and grit their teeth. Truly, the narrator deserves a place among the ranks of the most revolting main characters in all of fiction and having to gleam the story from his perspective is simply agonizing. Abandon hope all ye who enter here, there is no profound insight or exciting drama to be found. There are no heroes, no redemption, just disgusting people having dinner.But speaking seriously, if you wanted to write an edgy, depraved, transgressive novel, you'd need to have a balance between morality and immorality. Any depraved main characters would need to have some redeeming quality to make the readers care about them. There'd need to be a humane element for the readers to hold onto. A Virgil to accompany us through the circles of hell. This book sadly doesn't have that. What a disappointment.</text></scrape>
