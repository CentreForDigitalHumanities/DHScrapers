The idea is fabulous - but the actual story was too much for me to believe. I think my two primary problems with the book lies with the narrator - Paul - and with the attitudes of all the characters in the book. Let me discuss each in turn. Paul - as a narrator is highly unreliable. We know that he has some kind of personal issue with his brother and seems to take great offense at having to take part in this meal - which he reminds us of numerous times. And, as the story progresses, Paul holds back names and dates and places to protect his family - we are told he has some unnamed psychological disorder. Which, I think could easily be identified as schizophrenia. Then there are the flashbacks he has - most of which involve him attacking and beating people up. Did the events happen? Did anything in the novel actually happen or were they all a figment of his paranoid imagination? I found the number of questions and plot holes throughout Paul's story to be too many and too large to actually stand up. But my larger issue was with every other character in the book - and their upper-class, holier-than-thou attitude. Let me explain. The primary act that brings these two couples together is the death of a homeless woman in an ATM stall, a murder conducted by their two sons - witnessed by Serge's adopted son, Beau. The novel asks: what would you do to protect your child from having their future destroyed. Essentially - it drums down to: "my child's life is too important, and this dirty homeless person didn't matter so why are we even talking about this?" The overall attitude of everyone in the book seems to be that the woman deserved to die, simply because she was homeless and therefore not worth attention or life. Not once is this stance questioned or given a second thought. It is simply that these boys deserve to get away with this crime because the victim was homeless. In fact, the parents are willing to go to such lengths as attacking each other with further violence to prevent the boys from paying for their actions. I could not stand this attitude! It became the only thing I focused on throughout the novel. These are not people I want to know, much less read about.I opted to give the book 3 stars because of its writing and the fact that I found the story quite propulsive; however, those three stars come with reservations. </text></scrape>
