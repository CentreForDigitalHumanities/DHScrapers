I expected much more from it after reading reviews (even in "The Economist"!) and hearing from others.The beginning was promising - I liked the ironic and sarcastic style, non-linear sequence, how the person telling the story was grumpy about the whole fine dining experience. But when the story developed, and revelations kept coming, I got more and more bored. I just wanted to finish it quickly and start another book. I was not interested in the story, and did not care what happened to any of the characters. I find the story believable, but I think there are a lot of much better books written on topics explored here - "keeping up appearances", sibling rivalry, "the lengths parents will go to protect their children" (nothing too extreme in this book), psychological conditions, including various levels of autism, etc.</text></scrape>
