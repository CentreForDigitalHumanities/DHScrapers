Now maybe that is because I finished it in on day (not because it was spectacular but because I forgot it was homework and read it last minute) or maybe it's because i don't like reading in Dutch (no offence meant, i'm half Flemish and I talk Dutch at home as my first language) but i didn't enjoy it at all and couldn't wait to finish it. Maybe the translated version is better, maybe it's not my kind of book but I don't reccomend it. There are a lot of books better than this one so if you're thinking of spending your money on this, don't! You're welcome</text></scrape>
