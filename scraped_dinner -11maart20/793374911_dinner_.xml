If you're looking for loveable characters, this is not the book for you. But these characters are memorable! The book opens innocently and mundanely enough. The narrator is complaining about his brother, readers, if like me, can believe the brother is the villain the narrator is making him out to be. But as the plot unfolds, things aren't as they appear. With manipulation and violence, you discover what lengths these parents are willing to go to protect their children. There is a complete breakdown of morality and justice. With parents like these, it's not surprising the children have committed such a horrific act. I got the sense that this book was less about that act and the dinner to discuss the act, than about the narrators mental health and history of violence. Additionally, the characters were experts at manipulation, and I was genuinely surprised by their actions. At one point while reading this book, I said to my husband-"It's scary that children from such normal families can be so horrible!" As I continued reading, I quickly learned that the apple didn't fall far from the tree!I think this book makes you consider- what lengths would I go for my children? Where is the line drawn? Is there a different sense of right and wrong when it comes to defending your children?</text></scrape>
