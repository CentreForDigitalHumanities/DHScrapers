After the first few pages, I was thinking this was going to be great; it pulls you right in and gets you involved. It continued that way for 75 or so pages, and then things started to go very badly indeed. The protagonist, who seemed so clever and sympathetic at the beginning, began to turn into a real jerk, and the story got more and more horrific. It is set in Holland and translated from the Dutch; I realize things are different there and there may be things that just don't track from one language and one culture to another, but I think my dislike stems from more than that. I also realize that the author was intending for you to come to hate the main character, but the means by which he accomplishes this just ridiculous at times. For example, I couldn't believe in the first place that a school would call a parent in to express concern about an opinion expressed by a child in an essay about capital punishment, much less the end result of that conversation. Maybe call a parent in for a child not doing homework at all, or a pattern of doing it poorly, but not just because of an opinion expressed, an opinion that in American society is so mainstream to begin with... I also disliked his skirting issues by saying such things as "we went to a restaurant, but I'm not going to say which one; people might come there to see if we're there" or "my wife was in the hospital, but I don't want it to get around why she was in the hospital so I'm not going to say"; I felt that contrivance was "too cute by half", as my old boss would have said.The only blessing was that it was a quick read and so I got done with it quickly. I'm sorry I spent the time that I did on it.</text></scrape>
