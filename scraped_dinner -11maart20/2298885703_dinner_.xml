You sort of keep reading because it's vaguely interesting and there is an interesting element of tension, but for me it doesn't feel like it really pays off. It's a bit like chewing on a delicious chocolate that you've been looking forward to for a long time, and cerebrally you think you're enjoying it because it's creamy and caramelly and all the things you enjoy in a chocolate, but once you're finished you feel underwhelmed and wish that perhaps you'd bought the other chocolate instead.</text></scrape>
