The way Koch slowly revolves around the heart of the conflict and alters your understanding of the characters is genius, and kept me guessing: At first, the focal point hints toward the main character's relationship with his brother; then, a subtle shift and heavy foreshadowing toward some conflict with his son, Michel -- and to an extent, that remains a central theme. But ultimately, I feel the narrative makes a definite shift toward Paul and his unnamed illness, unreliable a narrator as Paul is, and left me with troubling questions over how much Paul's inability to fully adapt to societal rules and expectations influenced his son's later behaviour. The book obviously deals with questions of family dynamics, parenthood and loyalty: how far should a parent go to protect their child? I think most readers can grasp that rather easily -- and if not, there's a handy list of reading club questions in the back pages. What I was much more interested in were the questions of victimization that I felt Koch raised again and again throughout the course of the novel. What does it mean to be a victim? Obviously, the homeless woman the boys attack is a victim, of society, of the boys. The boys themselves, each in different ways, can be seen as victims -- is it fair for their lives to be ruined by one act, as Claire argues? Claire herself has been a victim of physical illness. Serge, the victim of politics, of public view, even of Paul; Babette, a possible victim of domestic abuse; Paul himself, a victim of mental illness. And yet, each possible "victim" in the novel can also be seen from the other side: as the perpetrator of abuse, of violence, of oppression. Confounding the clear answer is Koch's insistence on restraint: Paul is forever hesitant, holding back details that would clarify certain points, but don't actually detract from the story itself: He refuses to give the name or location of several places featured in the novel, including the restaurant itself; he refuses to identify what either his or Claire's illnesses are. Paul seems so careful about revealing too much, revealing anything that could allow a reader to intrude upon his life any more than he wants to allow, it left me wondering why exactly he's telling us this story to begin with, and also leaves the reader with another theme to play with: control. Each of the characters tries to assert his or her power over others, over the situation they find themselves in, and each, in a way, is powerless.Final thoughts: Fabulous book that completely consumed me while reading, and left me thinking about it long after I finished. 10/10 will reread.</text></scrape>
