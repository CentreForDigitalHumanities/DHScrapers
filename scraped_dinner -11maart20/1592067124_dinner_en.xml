It actually has an interesting set-up; it's a crime sort of thriller that takes place over the course of one dinner. Me, being vaguely interested by the premise, decided to buy this on a whim in my Kindle and it was very... eh.The thing about these kind of novels that I'm expecting is the thrill, the suspense that keeps me hooked on reading these (most likely) horrible characters. I don't need "action" for me to be thrilled, something that's just intriguing, cold and nasty, something like a conversation you'd see in a Quentin Tarantino film. And with The Dinner, you'd expect characters to fight off using words. There is a bit of that but nothing suspenseful to keep me hooked. It got boring really fast.And what I'm really disappointed about this is that the characters don't get to talk about what they're supposed to talk about (the horrible crimes their sons did) until approximately 80% of the book. So 200+ pages are spent in describing the food, beating around the bush and hundreds of flashbacks which I'm sure some of them could be removed. We barely got to see the nasty dinner these characters are having due to the overly amount of flashbacks stacked upon the other. And when we get to that moment of "climax" where they finally discuss about the crimes, it wasn't even a climax. It was anti-climactic and dull. About the characters, they're all horrible. I like assholes sometimes only if their characterization is done well. One example is Gillian Flynn, where she writes the darkest and most despicable of characters ever known. But I like these characters not because of what they've done but because of how ingeniously complex and well done they are. In this one, they're all dicks and they're nothing more than that. They are paper flat and thin, nothing more than one layer. Heck, I didn't even get a good enough reason of why these boys are doing these horrible crimes. Did they find it fun? Koch doesn't give us a layer behind what these characters do and I find that unrealistic and one dimensional. Overall, The Dinner is a mess of a story. It doesn't give the characters a good explanation of their crimes, other than them being psychotic assholes. It also avoids its own story by beating around the bush too much and it spends too much of its time in the past that it forgets about the present. It's convoluted and I didn't find it enjoyable nor thrilling.Instagram | Twitter | IMDb</text></scrape>
