How far would you go to cover up a horrible crime? How high are the steaks?
Written over the course of a dinner, with flashbacks interspersed,The Dinner tells the story of two brothers. and a decision that must be made to protect their children.
At the beginning, you definitely have an affection for one side, but towards the end you realize that they are all ruthless. A good book, that I could see turned into a movie.</text></scrape>
