I suppose it did what it was supposed to do...it hooked me from the beginning and I plowed through it. A short and easy read. There were no likable characters in this book. They all should have been committed. But the narrator was just over-the-top sick. He was narcissistic, hateful, spiteful, with no sense of morality or responsibility and had some serious anger issues. Then, you find out everyone in the book is like this. The thread of "evil is inherited" that ran through the book was strange and unbelievable. This was an extremely dark and twisted book. Too much so. And that comes from someone who kinda likes dark and twisted.</text></scrape>
