No----2 ratingDid I like the concept? Yes---4 ratingDid I like the writing style? Yes---4 ratingDid I like the believability factor? No---2 rating The concept is interesting but trite. Two couples go for dinner to discuss an abhorrent act committed by their sons. The two males at dinner are brothers and come with much of their own baggage, which helps to explain why their sons did what they did.The story takes place over a full course dinner at an elite restaurant which makes no sense at all in the real world. In the real world a discussion like this would take place in the privacy of your own home with no witnesses to hear or see anything. But, for literature's sake this story is told metaphorically through the courses of the dinner. The first course, Aperitif, starts out somewhat lightly as appetizers should, but we get a great sense that something huge is being worked up to. The main course takes a while to get to them, so tension builds in anticipation of the meal, and the big discussion to come, but even as the main course takes its time getting to the table so too does this conversation. The talk starts and stops leaving the reader wondering what a the build up is for.The middle third of the book is Dinner. Here is where you get some insight as to what has happened and what about these two families makes this incident so plausible. This is the meat and potatoes of the novel. The long look inside the characters, well mostly through the narrator and his skewed version of life; his, his wife's, his son's, his brother's, and his brother's wife and their son's.By Dessert everyone is full from dinner and appetizers, or from what they are and are not discussing. But, the dessert won't go away. One character just wants the waiter to take her dessert away. Make it disappear and things can go back to normal. Another character lets his dessert melt into something no one would want to touch but is still there sitting, melting, and signifies that which is rotten and soon to be exposed.The metaphors continue through to the end of a book that I am not sure I liked or not.I am interested to see more reviews from others.</text></scrape>
