But the premise was interesting and a bit different.And to start with, it loved up to that premise. There is so much tension between and within the two couples, and I found myself racing through to find out exactly what had happened. Yes, the 'crime' is a horrible one and takes your breath away.After that revelation, I kind of felt that the story went flat a bit. We become a little lost in flashbacks and vague reminisces by the main character, and to be honest, started to lose faith in what he was reporting.The ending is also a bit weird - I mean, it's drastic, but I'm sure it would mean that the story would get out even quicker!So, overall, a good read, but not one I would want to read again.</text></scrape>
