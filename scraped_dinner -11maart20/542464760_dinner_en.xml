Everything seems perfectly normal until oh shit what the fuck did I just read what is happening, that's what this novel is like. The narrative is really gripping and engaging which causes you to not want to put this down, and I literally didn't I read it in one sitting. There are no other novels that I can compare this to so I'm gonna use my opening sentence's example and compare it to the filmography of Austrian director Michael Haneke. This is like "Funny Games" with a smattering of "Benny's Video" with the aftertaste of "Cache" and the sentimentality of "Amour". </text></scrape>
