I find myself always so confused when I finish thrillers. I never know how to feel about them. There's always parts I like and parts I dislike. I've actually yet to find one that I would give 5 stars to. What I really liked about The Dinner was the authors descriptions about food. That was my favourite part. I liked the way the book was split up into sections and the metaphor between each section and what was happening during the story. It was very well put together. Loved the authors writing! It was so fluid which made for an ease of reading. What I disliked was the characters. They were so awful. I also disliked the story itself because I'm still in the dark about what exactly was "the illness". No spoilers but that's all I'm going to say!3.5 stars from me! </text></scrape>
