Like others here, I have my gripes; why go to a public space to discuss highly personal matters, why were the kids so protected when they were clearly evil little f#####s, why did any of the party not become worried when their fellow dinner guests were outside for like 20 mins/half an hour at a time! I suppose these plot foibles are what they are. The best parts of the book for me were the frustrations regarding the pretentiousness of the restaurant and the endless describing of dishes and pointing and hovering with the little finger to certain dishes!! I found this hilarious! The mental illness aspect of the father was fascinating for me too, including the reference to when the mother had the amnio and decided to go ahead (speaking for the both of them). An interesting subplot there. This reminded me of an extreme version of the film Carnage. Herman Koch is a talented writer with an eye for satire in my opinion.</text></scrape>
