But that never worked. I always thought things through to the end, to their most extreme consequence.Although I relate to the above sentence, the book was meh.I was going to write that it was my "high expectations" that had it in for me and didn't help with my liking of the book, mostly because a favourite Youtuber of mine recommended it; but no, I didn't have "high expectations" for this one, mainly because I had no clue what this book was actually about. I had also read some pretty raving reviews by Greek sites, back when the book first hit stores (yes, I have a good memory) But still, my expectations weren't particularly high, the recommendations just got me to read it sooner rather than later.Don't get me wrong, I'm not giving this book a "meh" rating because I was shocked, or appaled, or disgusted by anything that happened in the book, the most extreme reaction it got from me was raised eyebrows. Some events described in the book are, indeed, messed up and twisted, but... really? That's it, like Edward said? That's probably why the "plot" only kicked in in the middle of the book or so, there wasn't much "meat" in the story at all. That, or it was the usual ~mystery~ that's supposed to keep you guessing and reading till it's finally revealed.Well, colour me unimpressed. The reason I kept reading until the end was not to see what happened/ what would happen with the boys, but because I really enjoyed Paul's analyses of everything around him, each and every small movement, reaction, event around him. I really enjoy perceptive characters like that, I love any medium that lets me into someone's head, so to speak; even if it is through another character.This isn't a bad book, but it was, apparently, not for me. Too bad.</text></scrape>
