The narrator did an excellent job of using his opinion of the other main characters, notably his wife, his brother and his wife, to influence how I would feel about the characters before I met them. The format of the book is based on the courses you would have at an upscale restaurant. The two couples are meeting to discuss what needs to be done about a despicable act that their sons have committed. Over the course of the meal, I patiently waited for the discussion and what the proposed solution would be, but first the narrator unravels his life and how he formed his opinion of the other characters and I had to take off my rose-colored glasses as the narrator had fooled me into thinking he is the good guy. Also, through the course of the meal we learn about the despicable act through the narrator’s flashbacks and thoughts while the dinner conversation is around everything but the act with all of the sarcastic barbs with a lot hidden undertone. All polite conversation and civility end when the brother proposed a solution that the narrator and his wife thinks is selfish and would adversely affect their son’s future. By this time all of the characters are unlikeable to me, but I was left wondering what I would do in their situation if it was my child.Themes of what constitutes a happy family, the lengths parent go through to protect their child and his future, what constitutes a childish prank or is an indication of a bigger problem, how do we teach and impose ethical behavior on others make for book club discussions. A couple of twists had me reading to the end but the uneven pacing and the rush to the end made this at time a slightly monotonous read.</text></scrape>
