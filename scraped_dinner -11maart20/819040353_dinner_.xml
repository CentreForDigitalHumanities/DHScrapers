Their adopted African son, who urges them against the MURDER, blackmail the boys for a pretty small amount considering, he's up to no good, his aunt arranges for him to be silenced by any means necessary. And somehow blames the homeless woman for seeking warm shelter in an ATM enclave.I do not recommend this book. Seriously, I was stoked to see it in my library's digital reserve because I picked up a physical copy in Barnes & Nobel and thought about buying it. I'm glad I just wasted my time and not my dollars.</text></scrape>
