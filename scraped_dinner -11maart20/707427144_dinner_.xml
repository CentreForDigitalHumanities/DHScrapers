What will their parents do to protect them? That is the premise of this book. The parents meet at an upscale restaurant in Holland (where the book takes place) to discuss their children. The story is recounted by the father of one of the teens. We hear his inner thoughts and learn the background through him, going back and forth from the different parts of his and his family's life to the different courses of the dinner and present day events. The beginning of the story was difficult to follow. But it became easier as I became used to the author's / narrator's voice and began to understand the problem. While I found the story compelling and did want to read to know how it ended I was sorely disappointed in the ending. Frankly, I was fairly sure I would be by the time I was half to three quarters through it. I found none of the characters redeeming in any shape, manner or form. I found the premise, repulsive. I am not squeamish, by nature and don't generally shy away from violence as a rule. However, I just could not stomach or condone the parents in this book! Only one father, even remotely tried to do the right thing, but not necessarily for the right reasons. It was all just a bit too much! I gave it 2 stars because it kept my interest but that is all.</text></scrape>
