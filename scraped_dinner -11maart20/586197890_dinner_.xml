But I'm also a reader who enjoys despicable characters. If you need someone to "root for", this is not the book for you. The story centers on the premise that two brothers and their wives have met for dinner where they will eventually discuss an incident that involves their children. One of the brothers, Paul, is the main narrator and becomes the main focus of this book. I really can't explain much more about this book except to say that I think it could be considered a readalike for Gone Girl but also We Need to Talk About Kevin...Those two books are pretty different and don't necessarily appeal to the same audiences...which makes this a fairly risky choice for Gone Girl readers at least..I think it's a pretty safe bet for We Need to Talk About Kevin readers though... Fast, dark, maddening...</text></scrape>
