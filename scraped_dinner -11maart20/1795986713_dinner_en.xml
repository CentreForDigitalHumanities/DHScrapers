The men are brothers, and one is running for major political office. But they are not here to discuss their careers, they are here to discuss their teenage children, and the role those boys have played in a shocking incident.Well, this certainly went in a direction I was not expecting. I was completely fascinated by the psychological nuances explored in these two couples. Paul is the narrator of this family drama; he is a former history teacher. His own psychology colors what he observes, as well as what – and how – he reveals what is happening. Claire is Paul’s wife, a woman he readily admits “is smarter” than he is. Their dinner companions are Paul’s older brother Serge Lohman, and his wife Babette. Over the course of this meal – aperitif, appetizer, main course, dessert and digestif – they dance around the very serious situation their sons have gotten into. Emotions are triggered, and just as quickly suppressed. How can you possibly have a truly open discussion about such a serious topic in a public restaurant? The fact that they have chosen this venue is as revealing about their family dynamic, and individual motivations, as anything they actually say (or don’t say). I can hardly wait for my F2F book group discussion!Clive Mantle does a fine job performing the audio version. He has good pacing, and he gives Paul a sort of hypnotic, suppressed voice … it’s as if he is an outsider and not affected by the events. Chillingly eerie and yet perfect for this work. </text></scrape>
