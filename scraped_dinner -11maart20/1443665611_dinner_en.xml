He and his wife, Claire, are scheduled to meet his insufferable brother, Serge, and his wife, Babette, for dinner. The story takes place over the course the shared meal during which time Paul pieces of the trouble his son become fuller and Paul has an opportunity to reflect on what circumstances have led his family to the story's ultimate conclusion.This book is not for everyone. If you need to like a character this is not for you. There is absolutely nothing redeemable about any of these characters. I've also seen the book compared to Girl on The Train. I would caution against this. I don't think this is a suspense novel and not really even a mystery. I did, however, enjoy the book. Koch is an incredibly descriptive writer. You would have to be to draw a book out within such a condensed timeframe. But, the strength of the book is in the dynamics between the characters and the revelation of the personalities of the characters through their relationship to each other. I would recommend reading it. The audio version was very well done.</text></scrape>
