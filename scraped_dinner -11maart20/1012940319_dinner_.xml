It had some fascinating themes and raised difficult questions. While there were a few flaws - e.g. it does seem ridiculous that they would go to an expensive restaurant to discuss a very sensitive, secretive matter - I thought it was generally a good portrait of a seriously messed up group of people. Some readers have complained in their reviews that they didn't like any of the characters, but I really don't see this as a problem. Why does there always need to be a nice, 'normal' character? It's quite refreshing to read about a bunch of nasty people who are all f***ed up in slightly different ways. Because it's quite short and a lot of issues are raised, it's a good option for a book club. Very much looking forward to discussing it at our next book club! </text></scrape>
