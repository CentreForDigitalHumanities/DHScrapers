It was innocuous at first, and then the further you read the more disturbing it becomes, which was the point, of course. Dutch brothers, one a successful politician, meet, along with their wives, to discuss a problem with their sons over dinner. The writing was okay, but this is one review that isn't about the writing. I feel I can't say anything in too much detail because the entirety of it will be a spoiler. Let me say, when if finally dawned on me what the book was actually about, I pretty much hated reading it from then on, but felt compelled to finish, hoping to find some sort of solace with what happened. There was no solace. Now I hope to quickly forget it. This involves four of my least favorite things that a book can contain, which are: (view spoiler)[1) An unreliable narrator. 2) An unreliable narrator who is mentally ill. 3)An unreliable narrator who is mentally ill, but you don't know that for the first 240 pages. 4) A teenager with no redeeming qualities, who may also be mentally ill or is possibly just an asshole to the tenth degree. (hide spoiler)]Needless to say, this book was not for me. Also -- lots had to be inferred, to the point where I thought I'd skipped a ton of pages. I went back through to try to figure out what was going on. It turned out I hadn't skipped any pages at all. I felt like I was trying to play connect the dots with the character Paul -- too much so. I had no idea what was happening. The perpetual vagueness concerning his state didn't need to be... I don't know... that vague. It ended up being confusing, not intriguing. Also -- what in the name of all that is pure is wrong with these damn wives? Does no one have a conscience? It seemed completely unbelievable. Now I have a headache. So, yeah, not for me. They're turning this into a movie starring Richard Gere. No thanks. </text></scrape>
