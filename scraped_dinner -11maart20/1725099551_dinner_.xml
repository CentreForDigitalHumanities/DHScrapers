The voice of the main narrator grips you because he is that awesome combination of cruel, honest and insightful. Even though the story is not representative of any situation you ever want to be in, you can relate to so many aspects of it. I was so upset by the cruel thing the boys did. One of the most memorable scenes of any novel but I don't want to give it away! From start to finish i was helpless to out this book aside. The story plays out with such engrossing characters that you are addicted right to the last page. Cannot say enough good things about this book and author's writing,</text></scrape>
