After reading it, I can see why. The writing is strong, but the storyline I found to be odd and very dark. The characters were very dysfunctional and the ending just came out of no where and left me feeling out of sorts. It's a popular novel right now and I'm a bit unsure why or how that happened. There are many better books to read.</text></scrape>
