But.....I HATED the last quarter of the book. Lots of people I know did enjoy this book so I definitely think this is a case of "It's me, not you", but I was so ticked off by so many things that happened near the end. I kept hoping the book would redeem itself in the end somehow, but it just did not.</text></scrape>
