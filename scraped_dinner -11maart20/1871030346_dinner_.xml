The narrator really draws the reader into the familial saga with his conspiratorial tone and admittedly edited remembrances. The complicated and trying mental health issues observed and lived by the narrator add layers to this novel that truly make it stand out to me as a well-written tome. Overall, a great read that deserves a higher average rating than it currently holds.</text></scrape>
