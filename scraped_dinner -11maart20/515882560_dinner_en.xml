It is a dark combination of (view spoiler)[mental illness (hide spoiler)], egotistical politicians, irritating behaviors (Mr. Pinky Finger), despicable actions, blackmail, cover-ups and (view spoiler)[murders (hide spoiler)] (at least that's how I see it). Read it yourself and see how Paul, Claire, Serge and Babette handle the big discussion relating to the heinous crime(s) committed by their 15 year old sons.Despite the peculiarity of this satire, I enjoyed it and actually found it laughable at times!</text></scrape>
