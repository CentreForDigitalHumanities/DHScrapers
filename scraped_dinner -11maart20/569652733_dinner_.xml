I pleased to report that in this case, it's about extremely well crafted, highly readable prose, and given that this book has been translated, that means kudos to both author and translator. I predict you finish this book quickly, maybe even in a single gulp. That said, I have to be honest and say that the 'shocking truth" that all the characters are talking around throughout dinner is just not all that shocking. What would have been enough plot for three pages of one of my books floats this entire novel. The last page shocker isn't all that stunning, either. But I still suspect you'll enjoy this, because the writing is fine and there are some moments of genuinely insightful character examination.</text></scrape>
