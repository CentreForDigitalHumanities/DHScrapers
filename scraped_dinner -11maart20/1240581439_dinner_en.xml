I did not care for the characters. I wasn't draw into the plot. I felt no satisfaction as the "mysteries" were revealed. Was this my bad or the author's? I can't be sure, so I am not giving it the single star I would under circumstances, one of which is that I know others who were very enthusiastic about all the above.The book could as easily have been a play. Almost all the action takes place in a restaurant. There are four principal characters, two couples: Paul and Clair/Serge and Babette. Paul and Serge are brothers. Paul has been unemployed for over ten years. Serge could be the next Dutch prime minister. They are like oil and water. The contrasts range from the way they raise their children (They both have teenage children.) to their politics and world views. We are given the baggage they bring to the dinner in a series of flashbacks from Paul's point of view. Their sons have engaged in mutual criminal activity. None of the four parents is sure what the other couple knows, but the boys could be arrested for a crime that has captured the nation's attention and would have consequences for Serge's political future as well. The book is structured as a play with each scene being a separate course of their meal. Introduced, by the fatuous staff of this expensive restaurant, we get further clues into the four from their choices and how the meal is discussed around the table. Koch is showing us how each relates to the concepts of family and happiness. I didn't find myself wanting the lesson he offered.</text></scrape>
