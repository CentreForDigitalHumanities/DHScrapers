I thought the reader did a great job with Paul's voice. I know Paul was supposed to be a mostly unlike ale character but there were times when I found him quite amusing and humorous.

I saw a lot of reviewers likened this to Gone Girl, which I don't really see. I thought it was more like Defending Jacob. It didn't have that twists and turns of Gone Girl and had more of the moral/ethical issues that Defending Jacob had.</text></scrape>
