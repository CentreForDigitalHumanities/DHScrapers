I devoured it in one sitting and thought it was brilliant, thought provoking, undeniably funny and haunting... somehow all in one book. The book follows Paul, the narrator, mostly during a dinner date with his wife, brother, and sister in law. His brother Serge is currently on the political trail, hoping to become the next Prime Minister of Holland. It also flashes back and forth to the recent past, mostly concerning his teenage relatives, his son Michel and nephews Rick and Beau (an adopted boy from Ghana who was brought up with Serge's family). Without giving too much away, something happens with these boys and the parents are meeting to discuss what they are going to do about it. Firstly, I thought the narrator, Paul, was hilarious. There were numerous scenes during the book that I was actually laughing out loud, probably because I compared him to my boyfriend. The thing with Paul is, he does not like having a lot of money. He would rather spend his money elsewhere. In particular, he has a really big issue with the fact that the waiter is constantly pointing to the items on the menu, and food, with his pinky finger. There are so many witty one liners in this book, and I couldn't help but think that Paul was, although extremely flawed, absolutely amusing.Secondly, I love character based plots. I could read hundreds and hundreds of pages of very little plot as long as I feel like I know the characters well. I really enjoyed the conversations during the dinner, especially between Serge and Paul. I liked seeing the characters slowly show more and more of their personalities, and more than that, exposing their flaws. Side note, who would have known that one character, Serge, could have so many flaws? One thing I really liked was the way the storyline with the sons developed. It was by no means the focus of the book, which made for a more interesting read. I would describe this book as a character driven drama/thriller, however it could have read as a cliche filled thriller had it been done incorrectly. You find more about what happened with the boys little by little. If you have read 'We Need To Talk About Kevin,' it is very similar in the way it is not about what the child or children did, but the responses of those around them. I really could rant on and on about how much I enjoyed this book, but then it leaves nothing to the imagination for the reader. Although I loved this book, I do see how this book has a low rating. Like I have said, this is a character driven story, not plot. If you have a shorter attention span maybe you would find it tedious and ridiculously drawn out, but that is actually what I loved about it.Up until the last page I was going to give this book a 4 star rating, but all it took was that last haunting page that changed everything for me. That last page was hands down the most terrifying page of a book I have ever read. I actually got shivers reading it.</text></scrape>
