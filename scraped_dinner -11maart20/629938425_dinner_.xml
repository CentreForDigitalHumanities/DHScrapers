To me, this book is nothing like Gone Girl. Certainly, there is a mystery to what the characters will do, but many books are like that, the entirety of this novel wasn't in any form like the story by Gillian Flynn. That said, I also have to state that I liked the book in the way that I was drawn in to finding out the ending, however, I also found it too drawn out for me. The ending I saw coming and I was annoyed. It was flat, and the build up was merely a let down. I didn't feel connected to the characters in any way. The father seemed like he might even been highly functioning autistic and I also just didn't like him. He was racist and shallow; without a character to feel endeared to, there just isn't any investment in the story on the whole. *sigh* bit of a disappointment.</text></scrape>
