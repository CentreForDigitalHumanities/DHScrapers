While both books have unreliable narrators and morally absent characters, the resemblance pretty much ends there. I finished this book feeling that a lot of things didn't quite make sense and with a lot of remaining questions. I especially had trouble with the concept that mental illnesses can be inherited and detected in amniotic fluid before a child is born -- really?</text></scrape>
