Not sure why. Not sure what I am supposed to learn, if anything about what the author is trying to relate....don't care. The entire book is about one night at dinner, one brother who is famous and about to take part in an election for Prime Minister in Holland, his wife, and the jealous brother and his wife. A discussion needs to take place about their respective sons. The author feels the need to describe everything and veers off and stays gone from the story for long stretches. This is his writing method in order to fill in the details of these sick characters. Of course he must veer off for a book of this length - less than 300 pages, as it covers just one evening of dining. The funny parts were his descriptions of the expensive restaurant that the political brother has chosen for the evening. Every part of the meal is described by the waiter and reminded me of cable TV's Portlandia satire. The waiter uses his pinky finger to describe the food, which is so special it needs introduction. Okay, funny satire on expensive restaurants in the Western world. The funny snarky writing gets you into the book, but it all deteriorates. I skipped enormous parts of the last 50 pages. The reader already knows where the book is going, how the characters react, their motivations. The writing style is a bit choppy, the level of side-stories irritating, the job of describing pathological individuals and the lengths they go, in order to control others is pretty much the story. I cannot believe this book sold so many copies as I think it is just a cheap, fast way to write a book. Find something disgusting, describe mentally depraved people, and readers will flock to it! Wheeeee!! Look at human nature! See? Just go watch a reality show on TV. Junk.</text></scrape>
