I am on a mystery kick as of lately and I had high hopes for this one. Most of the time I found myself thinking "okay... get to the point, I don't really care what you are eating." If you are looking for suspense I wouldn't recommend this one! The only similarity I can compare to Gone Girl is very unlikable characters. :(</text></scrape>
