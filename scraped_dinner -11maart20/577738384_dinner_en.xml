Its intriguing to me why some people hate this book while others love it. (I feel I can understand both points of view --and respect 'both' points of view)....Yet here are reasons I LOVED this book:I could hold a full length conversation about ALL of the characters in this story. I could find 'much' to talk about EACH of them!!This was a page-turner--(disturbing --with twists and turns) --A book which had me thinking from page one --and will keep me thinking long after having read it. I had a little fun with the satire of the uppity-posh restaurant experience also: ("Lamb's neck sweetbread-marinated in Sardinian olive oil-served with arugula" ---the manager pointing with his pinky ---"Sun-dried tomatoes came from Bulgaria" ---Expensive plates took on the look of emptiness.....A Wine connoisseur I am not --however I still could imagine the "earthy aftertaste"....(lol) ---just glad I wasn't paying for it! :)I learned an interesting Dutch Historical fact --(somewhat distorted round-about-observation by the character Paul Lohman) ----but still interesting detail about Anne Frank.....(OK, maybe I have a disorder, also)....lolBut I think its fun to read a book that:1) is a fast read--2) calls for lots of discussion with your friends and other reads--3) Brings up more questions than answers4) Has you wonder??? For example: How much would I defend my family? --How far would I go --pass my moral integrity....etc.THE ENDING of the BOOK: (the part of the book which is very over-the-top.....the part of the book which I think is the either 'FOR IT ---or AGAINST IT' ---LIKE IT --or NOT) --- was done on purpose -- (Readers 'at least' have a REACTION). This book feels 'somewhat' real ---yet much is satire also: being a nice balance! I think the flow--(the pacing of the writing) was excellent.I look forward to talking with my friends about this story.I'll end my review with a powerful -'theme' quote in "THE DINNER" (by the character Paul Lohman --the narrator):"Something in me whispered I needed to stop thinking, that above all not go too far with the thinking--but that never worked. I had to think things through to their most extreme consequence."Congrats to the author! Interesting Frickin Discussion-type book!!!</text></scrape>
