The book starts out with wry and delightfully snide, witty commentary by our narrator on pretentious restaurants and waiters. I found myself laughing out loud and almost liking Paul. But all is not as it seems and Paul is the most unreliable of narrators. The story evolves slowly and the tension builds as more of the story is revealed in courses. It was impossible for me to put down until the last page was turned. This is a book that you simply must discuss when you finish. It would make a fabulous choice for book clubs.Edited to add: Having just finished Anna Karenina 2 weeks ago, I loved the references to Tolstoy and happy families.</text></scrape>
