The narrator unravels the story over a dinner with his brother, sister in law and wife. The calm and ordinary way he tells you the most horrific things, chilled me to the bone. I can see the comparison to "Gone Girl" as you do dislike the characters, but are compelled forcefully to find out what happens next. Now I am left wondering how this family gets on with life after all that's happened, and will they ever be found out? Terrifying and fascinating at the same time!</text></scrape>
