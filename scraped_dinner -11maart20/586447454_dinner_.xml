From Aperitif to Digestif, the story of the violent act unfolds, punctuated by digressions into dark family secrets and family politics. Although the concept is quite interesting, the story falls flat and the interludes become long and distracting. I debated between 2 and 3 stars, mainly because the book does bring up several thought-provoking and discussion-worthy questions, perfect for my upcoming book club meeting!</text></scrape>
