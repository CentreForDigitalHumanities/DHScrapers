Biological familial ties vs. those born of adoption. The lengths parents will go to in order to protect their children vs. merely enabling monstrous behavior. All of those things - and many more - are questions and dilemmas introduced in this book, and I have to say, it really does make you think.I won't go into deep detail about the plot because I don't want to give anything away, and there will only be, at most, mild spoilers in this review.We are presented with four main characters: Paul (the narrator) and his wife Claire; and Paul's brother Serge and his wife Babette. Everything is told from Paul's POV, so all of our information comes from the filter of his mind, as it were. When the book begins, we're given his impressions of everyone and everything around him: from the goings-on in the restaurant and the actions of its staff, to his deep and abiding loathing for his brother. Paul is a man who clearly loves his wife, and looks at the world with a hefty mix of cynicism and wit. Serge, on the other hand, is a stereotypical politician in that he's all about appearances and the acquisition of both power and social standing. The women are less fleshed-out; we find out that Claire is smarter than Paul, has been through a serious illness, and loves her son Michel. Babette is, in my view, the least developed of the four adults: her marriage with Serge isn't rooted in love as is the one between Paul and Claire, at least not anymore; she's more of a long-suffering wife who's fed up with her husband (who couldn't care less) but stays with him because she enjoys the trappings of his career and power. She also loves her sons: Rick and Beau, the latter of which was adopted and, from the impression that I got, is lavished with more of Babette's affection than Rick, while Serge seems to keep Beau more at arm's length.As previously mentioned, Paul is the narrator and he rather frequently mentions how he won't be naming some people or institutions or giving us the terms for medical conditions that rear their heads as the story progresses. Even with those omissions, I wouldn't necessarily categorize him as unreliable: he is brutally honest about everything, and though he takes his time filling us in on all that's gone on, we do wind up getting the whole story.All in all, I found this to be a fast read. I know that other reviewers found it frustrating that so many pages pass before we really get into the nitty gritty of the story, but I think the pages prior to the most important reveals serve the function of letting us know that things start off not-so-great and will only continue to devolve into a situation that gets progressively darker and more chilling and disturbing. I didn't mind the pacing because I think it was important to get all of that initial insight into Paul and his feelings about those around him before the proverbial rug is pulled out from under the reader. One of the things that I liked the most about this book is that the reader's sympathies are not static: those who initially appear to be the most down-to-earth and easy-to-root-for are not necessarily all what they appear to be, and vice versa. There are just so many secrets and instances of manipulation and desperate acts that all sort of boil over into truly unexpected decisions and happenings.The act that initially brings the dinner party together is horrific and deplorable, and unfortunately, an action the likes of which winds up on the news with not-a-little frequency these days. For much of the book, we're left to wonder why it happened and what prompted the boys to be so monstrous. As the story unfolds, layers into both their motivations, influences, and subsequent actions are peeled away like layers on an onion and it is at this point where the questions mentioned at the beginning of this review race to the fore. The reader is left to ponder who amongst the characters is actually free of blame as more secrets, lies, desperation, parental love, psychological illness, deep resentments, blackmail, and violence are revealed.I think this is an extremely well-written, suspenseful book that really keeps you on your toes and makes you think. The first blurb from an author on the back cover comes courtesy of Gillian Flynn, and it's easy to see why: both she and Herman Koch excel at twists and turns and ever-deepening darkness and intrigue. This is a great book, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a smart, deeply interesting novel of (what I think would be appropriately labeled as) psychological suspense.</text></scrape>
