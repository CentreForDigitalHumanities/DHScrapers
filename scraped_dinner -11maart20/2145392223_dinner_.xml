Endless prattling by the narrator about things that have nothing to do with the book, other than to further emphasize what a completely reprehensible person he is. I hated all the characters, a bunch of spoiled, self-centered, entitled jerks. This could easily have been a short story of about 10 pages, since that's all the content of actual story it contained.</text></scrape>
