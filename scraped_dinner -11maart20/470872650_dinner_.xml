I'm sure this was the author's intention, because reading the book forces the reader to evaluate his or her own prejudices against that of the story's narrator.The strength of the book is that these beliefs and attitudes come through in increasing waves throughout the book, such that it becomes more and more obvious where he is coming from. I found it a delicious technique of showing the logical conclusion of where such attitudes and beliefs could lead. The scary and dramatic results of the plot are not out of line with what could happen in reality, not only in northern Europe, where the story takes place, but in any large city.</text></scrape>
