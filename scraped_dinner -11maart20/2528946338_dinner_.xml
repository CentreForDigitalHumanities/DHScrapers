On page 89 exactly is where the book’s plot actually begins. There are only 100/297 pages dedicated to the plot. The other almost 200 pages are weird memories and unrelated thoughts the narrator has about his past and about nonsense. This book was soo horrible I couldn’t even finish it! I am genuinely frustrated I wasted my time on giving this book a shot. Oh man, those glorious ratings on the cover and back are lies. This book’s narrator is also very annoying and plays this victim role throughout the entire book. Just don’t even waste your time. </text></scrape>
