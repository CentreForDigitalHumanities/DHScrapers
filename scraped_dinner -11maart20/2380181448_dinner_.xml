It was overpowered with unnecessary details and I couldn't relate to it or any of its characters in any way. The only thing that I found interesting was the food, but it would make more sense if the story was supposed to be about food since it wasn't even that became irritating after a while.
Not a book I recommend. On my cover, it mentions that it's an unputdownable book, quite the contrary, I would put it down and not pick it up again. Sorry.</text></scrape>
