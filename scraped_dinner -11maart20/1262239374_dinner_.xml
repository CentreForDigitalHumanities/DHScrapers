I’m thrilled that the Socratic Salon will be discussing The Dinner on May 20 because it gave me a reason to give it a chance…and, it ended up being one of the best books I’ve read this year! Not much happens in the beginning of the story, but I was so busy reveling in Koch’s brilliant writing and biting social commentary that I didn’t even realize that the characters had merely arrived at the restaurant and ordered food. Koch’s commentary takes aim at politicians, general pretentiousness, wine snobs, and snooty wait staff (the restaurant’s manager reminded me of the maitre d’ in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”). But, rest assured, the action does pick up, resulting in a multi-layered, literary novel that is also suspenseful (one of my favorite combinations!). The “action” portion of the story poses some great “what would you do” questions and ethical discussion topics…making this one a perfect choice for book clubs.For more reviews, visit my blog: www.sarahsbookshelves.com</text></scrape>
