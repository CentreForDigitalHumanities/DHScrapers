I couldn't put it down! The story unfolds through the mind of the narrator as he and his wife dine with his brother, an aspiring politician, at an upscale restaurant. As the meal and the narrative progress, tension builds as it becomes increasingly clear that none of the players nor the events are as they first appear.</text></scrape>
