Paul and Claire Lohmann are meeting Paul’s brother and sister-in-law, Serge and Babette Lohmann, for dinner at an upscale restaurant that ordinarily requires that reservations be made months in advance. However, because Serge is a local politician that is a shoe-in to be the next Prime Minister, it was no problem to get in. Serge told Paul that they have to talk about their sons. Paul and Claire have one teenage son, Michel. Serge and Babette have three sons: two biological (Rick and Valerie) and one adopted from Burkina Fasso (Beau). As indicated in the synopsis, Michel and the eldest of Serge’s children have committed a crime and that’s the reason behind the dinner.I don’t want to spoil the plot, so I will talk about the characters. At first, I felt a bit sorry for Paul. His brother seems to have it all: the gorgeous wife, the skyrocketing career, and a future as a political leader. Serge talks down to Paul, even insulting his taste in women when he callously mentions that Paul likes unattractive women. He seems like a real a$$hole, so I was taken by surprise when he was the one who actually was the only one making sense in the end. Paul wasn’t at all who I expected, and Claire threw me even more! There were some things that transpired in the novel (such as: Claire’s illness in the hospital) that weren’t adequately explained, so the reader is left to draw her own conclusions.So, an interestingly dark tale of how far someone would go to protect a loved one! There were secrets, secrets, and more secrets! The crime itself was disturbing to me. It actually sickened me that the seriousness of the crime was downplayed, and both Michel and Paul laid the blame on the victim. The author takes us into the past on numerous occasions, which is crucial to understanding the characters’ personalities. My opinions on the book’s characters definitely changed along the way!Narrator Clive Mantle is new to me, and I thought he was sensational! I loved how his voiced dripped with sarcasm whenever Paul spoke with or about Serge. Paul’s distaste for his brother was very apparent! The pace of the story does move slowly, but that is hardly noticeable when you are listening to Mr. Mantle.This review was posted on my book blog:http://darlenesbooknook.blogspot.ca/2...</text></scrape>
