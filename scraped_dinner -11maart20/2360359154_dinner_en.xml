The characters in The Dinner are all a bunch of sickos, but that isn't really evident until we get to know them deep and personal. Which I think Koch is saying might be true of some of our own acquaintances that we only know on the surface.

Also, to what length will a parent go to protect their child in trouble with the law? Apparently, pretty far indeed.

I enjoyed this addictive read on audio.</text></scrape>
