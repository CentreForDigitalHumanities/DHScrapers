I didn't like any of the characters. Not one! But I felt like I was on a runaway train and just had to stay on board. That said, I was riveted. I've said before that certain books aren't meant for everyone and this one deserves the most stars in that category. Others have written far better and more poignant reviews, but if you do decide to go for it, you've been warned.</text></scrape>
