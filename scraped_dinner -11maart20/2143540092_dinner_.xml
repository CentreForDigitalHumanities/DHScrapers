My opinions of the characters changed, not on purpose, while reading this novel and I am thankful that the author, Herman Koch, had the ability to make me question what exactly was going on. It was a quick read and it is great to discuss with people (like I did for the book club my friends and I started, with this book as our first pick).</text></scrape>
