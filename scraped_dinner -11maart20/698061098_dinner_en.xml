My stomach was turning by the end, not because of any one particular violent scene, but rather because of the way that the unrealistic characters responded to a handful of reprehensible acts throughout the story.**SPOILER ALERT**Paul, the narrator, actually starts off as an intriguing voice. However, this originally observant narrator begins to fall apart in a way that is painfully unrealistic. In the first third of the book, he makes witty, astute comments about the overpriced restaurant to which his ambitious brother, Serge (currently running to be the next prime minister of Holland), has invited Paul and his wife for dinner. Paul appears insightful and biting in his descriptions of the people around him. After a few chapters, the reader begins to question the rationality of the narrative voice, which I believe was part of Herman Koch’s intention. Paul’s actions and irrational anger that are slowly revealed throughout the novel demonstrate that he is very clearly unbalanced. I think that when a person is senselessly violent, irrational, paranoid, and overly willing to excuse drastically immoral behavior (such as murder), they are typically not as insightful and sharp-minded as Paul seems to be in his interactions with and observations of others. It is a duality that feels strikingly unbelievable to me. Paul’s impressively observant voice at the start of the novel completely disappears by the end. At that point, the only person he can effectively “read” is his wife, Claire – all other perception and rationality has fallen inexplicably away. There are no epiphany moments during the course of the dinner Paul is attending, so there truly is no explanation for why Paul’s attitude and once-astute thinking has changed so drastically.And what about the foundation of the plot, the restaurant at which Paul and his family are eating their dinner? During the course of the novel, Paul reveals several incidents in which he has threatened violence, or in which he has actually been violent with other people. About 10 years earlier, he smashed a hot pan into his brother’s face. Around that time, he had what appeared to be a nervous breakdown in front of his students, causing him to be suspended barring a positive psychological evaluation. Within a year of when the dinner is meant to take place, we learn that Paul very violently beat up his son, Michel’s, principle. The incidents of violence and irrationality are all entirely uncalled for, and yet, Serge and his wife, Babette, decide to have a very emotional, potentially polarizing, and absolutely PRIVATE discussion with irrational Paul in a PUBLIC setting. What?? There is never any proper explanation given for their choice of setting… Rather, I got the impression that Herman Koch had a “novel” idea about how to arrange a book around the various courses in a fine-dining restaurant…regardless of whether or not there was anything logical about the decision.Frustratingly, the reader never learns why Claire, Paul’s wife, is so gleefully willing to cover up the murder committed by her son, OR why she seems to off-handedly invite him to murder his cousin, Beau. At the very least, we feel that Paul’s violent, irrational actions are attributable to his unnamed mental disorder, but what is Claire’s excuse?? Did she struggle at all with her son’s horrible act? We never know. It would be possible to believe that she merely wants to smooth over the murder so that her family can move into a future unmarred by prison time, but the fact that she invites her son, Michel, to commit yet another murder shows that she is not simply trying to move on – rather, she is whole-heartedly embracing Michel’s (and Paul’s) psychoses. Claire is also an insightful, sharp character, so from where does this unfounded amorality stem? It is not believable.One reviewer on Goodreads observed that this is a book about characters with fascist tendencies: characters who believe that it is acceptable to respond to people who are weak and inferior with violence (and, even, murder). I quite like that understanding of the novel, and to some degree, I can accept it. Perhaps it would be a perfect explanation of Claire’s stance IF in addition to excusing the murder of a weak, “inferior” homeless woman, Claire hadn’t also invited her son to murder his adopted cousin. After all has been read and considered, I have to conclude that the setting and action of The Dinner are unrealistic, and that the majority of the characters are inconsistent and unrelatable. I would not recommend this.</text></scrape>
