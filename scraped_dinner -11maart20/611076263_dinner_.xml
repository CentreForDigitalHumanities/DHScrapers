It's politics attempts to fall somewhere along Haneke's

, but is actually closer to Haggis' abhorrent

, or maybe not that bad, maybe more like Soderbergh's heart-in-the-right-place

.And why am I comparing it to movies instead of other authors?Because it comes off as a screen play. The reveals; the shifts in time; the settings; the violence; the "shocks" all come off as perfectly framed for a future movie from some wannabe Euro auteur. There was never a time when I was shocked by the beauty of the prose. There were times when I greedily turned pages and rushed through his sentences. And that's great! Nothing wrong with that! Nothing wrong with that at all. But where was the the novel as novel, instead of the future screenplay I just read? Nope. Not there. Meanwhile, let's look at the bullshit comparisons to Bernhard. Bernhard simply can't be made into a movie. Bernhard pushes the musicality of his prose to something closer to insanity-inducing 60s minimalism, and his plots, if you can call them that, are wholly and typically in the protagonist's head. It's more rant then scene/setting/movie; more music than something visual. (And often deeply hilarious.) But this, this little violent angry book is redolent of the very bourgeoisie it seeks to attack. Easy and pat and with a nasty little message to remind its readers of their inherent fucked up nature: racism, classism, violent tendencies, etc. To remind them they, or you, white Euro person reading this book, are perpetuating all the evils of Western history, and if you deny it, you're lying to yourself. You're violent, hateful, privileged, and racist. Yawn. Thanks for telling me that, Herr Koch.But hell, it's still a good read; just not some fucking masterpiece.</text></scrape>
