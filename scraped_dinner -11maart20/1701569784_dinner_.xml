Not drunk enough to fall down, but definitely too drunk to drive. Couple that with the subject matter and it was a near disaster.I have to give Koch props for his clever way of revealing the "incident", wrapped as it was, in the steps of a dinner. Appetizer, main course, dessert, aperitif. You know almost from the first that something has happened to devastate this family. Well, these families when you realize that it's two brothers and their wives who are parents to the teens who have done whatever the hell it is. Whatever it is happens to be horrid and you are only fed clues as the evening progresses. This was a slow. slow reveal.The incident itself is reprehensible, but the parent's reaction to it made me feel dirty just for listening. I felt I needed a shower and since I was listening in my car, I had better to keep the windows tightly rolled up.Under normal circumstances, this kind of novel could be a spring board for conversations about morality and social responsibility, but because of the way the characters react, there is simply no room for that. You just have to read/listen and almost gag, sure in the knowledge that you would do better.</text></scrape>
