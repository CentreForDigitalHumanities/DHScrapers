This is a dark and disturbing tale of two brothers and their wives, not the greatest of friends at the best of times, who meet for dinner to discuss their children. They have each learned that their sons are guilty of a terrible crime, and each parent is trying to deal with the situation in his/her own way as well as determining how to confront the issue publicly. What is fascinating is the way the author has the evening play out, giving us background on each individual and situation, as well as revealing the personalities and character, or lack thereof. Many of their thoughts and actions are horrifying at first, but the reader actually comes to understand the twisted reasoning behind it all. I also have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the bits of humor injected as the author pokes fun at his fellow Dutch. (The book was originally written in Dutch but had a superb translator.) It is refreshing to come across people who can laugh at themselves and their fellow countrymen. Altogether an excellent book! </text></scrape>
