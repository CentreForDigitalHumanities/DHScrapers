I found the characters in this book deplorable and the narrator a whinging, whiny, psychotic dick. So why bother reading? Simply to get the answer: How far would someone go to protect those they love most? No spoilers here but the character they are attempting to protect was heinous and I had no sympathy nor empathy for the deplorable turd. Will admit the book did get better as it progressed and events unfolded but this occurred slowly and at times very arduously, especially given it was coming from such a disagreeable source. What a bunch of low life's.</text></scrape>
