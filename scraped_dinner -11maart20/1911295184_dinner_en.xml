You're probably aware that Shriver's novel is one of my favourite books OF ALL TIME, so maybe you'd like this one more if you've not read Kevin. The Dinner treats the same themes, such as nurture vs nature and how responsible parents are for the actions of their kids..Basically the parents of two boys, a brother and a cousin, recognise their two sons committing a heinous crime on security camera and are the only ones who recognise them. They meet for dinner to discuss what to do with the situation. Gradually, parts of the families' pasts are revealed and we get a possible understanding of why things turned out the way they did. But nothing is spelled out, there's a good deal of ambiguity and you're left to ponder how much impact certain things had (me trying to be vague), which I liked!.I did not, however, particularly enjoy the intense attention to detail of irrelevant or tiny things. I love in-depth novels where you're fully immersed in a life, but The Dinner goes too far sometimes. For instance, there's a moment when the narrator sees ~something~ on the security footage and it takes THREE FULL PAGES for us to find out what that tiny something is!!! I'm all for building suspense but I was beginning to lose interest. .Overall, I did enjoy it despite how much I've complained here, but I didn't find it groundbreaking and would recommend Shriver's novel over this if you're after a gritty discussion of inherited or learned evil!</text></scrape>
