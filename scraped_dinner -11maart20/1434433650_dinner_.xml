It starts as an awkward comedy of manners, hinting at some deeper tragedy. But you're sucked in so gradually to a world of terror - with a thin film of civility on top - that you end the book in near shock.

Recommended for anyone who wants to write slow, expert suspense. Read it with Post-It notes and a highlighter.</text></scrape>
