Recommended in the sense SHE absolutely loved it. I'd heard of the book, although knew nothing about the story. There is not one character in the story that I liked. They were all a little warped. I do not understand parents that hide, ignore, or do whatever it takes to cover up things there children are guilty of and in this story what occurred was BIG. I do like books that are not all sweet and happily ever after, but these characters frightened me, nothing was beyond their capabilities.</text></scrape>
