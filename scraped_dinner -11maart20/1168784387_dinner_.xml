I just...these characters. What is wrong with each and every one of them? There's protecting your family and there's being an outright sociopath. The latter prevails. And none of it really makes sense. What the hell are they thinking? What the hell was the author thinking? There are stories that are messed up in the best ways. Anything Gillian Flynn. Girl on the Train. The Luckiest Girl Alive. And then there are stories that are so messed up and not at all redeeming. The Dinner.Do yourself a favor skip this mind f*ck. </text></scrape>
