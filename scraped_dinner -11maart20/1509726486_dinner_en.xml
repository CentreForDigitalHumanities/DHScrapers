This novel had been recommended to me by a friend of a friend, who generally has steered me in the same direction of interesting, literary and not-to-be-missed fiction. Looking at the average rating, I realize that this novel has met with varying degrees of appreciation. Intellectually I liked the layers, the build up, the squirmy narrator Peter with his offensively violent and detached innocence; they were terrific building blocks increasing suspense and shrouding the ultimate conclusion of the story. As a reader, I was myself distanced and uninvolved, merely an observer to these duplicitous beings and very quickly calculated the power at its core. As with Gone Girl, I simply watched the author play out scenarios to expand their best creepy value until the book was over. The ONLY mystery to me, which was never answered, was that of which inheritable genetic "syndrome" would show up in amniotic fluid to necessitate medical intervention and advice for abortion. Although we know that the brains of psychopaths function differently and that the disorder is considered to be inherited, at this point in time no test differentiates nor would it ever reach such a "solution" if it did. That "tease" in the novel quite frankly irritated me. The more the world knows about psychopathology and malignant Narcissistic Personality Disorders, the safer people will be in real relationships. But, for those who get thrills from the kind of mind games and treachery inherent in a "psychological" novel, enjoy. </text></scrape>
