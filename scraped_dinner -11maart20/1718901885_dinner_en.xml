On one hand, it is well constructed and features incredible writing. I love how each section is named after a fancy dinner course, and the masterful plotting expertly reveals tantalizing portions of the dark story hiding behind the deceptively simple premise a little at a time. Some of the early observations by narrator Paul are so absurdly petty that they made me want to laugh out loud. On the other hand, this book contains some of the most despicable characters that I've ever encountered. I've always held the belief that a book does not have to contain likable characters to hold my interest or be considered good; here that notion is severely tested, with a few of the appalling late-game revelations making me physically recoil. Certainly memorable, but not for everyone. I definitely recommend the audiobook, as narrator Clive Mantle perfectly captures the novel's tone and spirit.</text></scrape>
