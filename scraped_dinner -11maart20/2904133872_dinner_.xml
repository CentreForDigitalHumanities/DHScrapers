To put it in context, I am a clinical psychologist who teaches personality and personality pathology courses. This novel is a rich example of storytelling where you learn more about the characters' motives, goals and tendencies as the story progresses. It's definitely not a book for everyone. Several of the characters are unlikable and actually get more unlikable as more is revealed. If you don't like that kind of thing, move on. But if you like flawed and complex characters and you can tolerate the misogyny of the first person narrator, it's a masterful unfolding in this story.</text></scrape>
