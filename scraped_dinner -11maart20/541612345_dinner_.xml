I can appreciate how cleverly the book is crafted, but I can't really say I enjoyed it--the tone is smug, and the characters are monsters. The revelations were timed well and the book's pacing was excellent; the way the book makes you feel about the characters, and how that changes through the novel, is really well done. However, I found it to be depressing; the violence felt sleek to me, and though I realize this was on purpose, the book just didn't work for me.</text></scrape>
