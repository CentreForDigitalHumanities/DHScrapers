The book sets you against yourself to a degree because of the particular humor and because we are called to identify with characters who we aren't, I don't think, meant to care for. I certainly don't care for any of the characters, which wasn't all that fun for me. Some of the plot points, such as the genetic illness/predisposition towards violence, failed to interest or convince me in any way, though my sense is it was meant to add to the dark existential humor. Whatever dark humor this book is trying to make itself rich with, is apparently not built for my sensibility. And if the novel is a philosophical exploration of family loyalty, or how quickly we as humans can shift into othering behavior (shedding light on our primordial and perhaps ungenerous "us vs them" parameters), again, for me, it wasn't a terribly compelling one. I am interested in the book's structure and appreciate the dinner being the organizing force. It allows Koch to set up the particular humor of the novel, to set up the relationship between the narrator and his brother, and the narrator's brother and his different publics. Here Koch is able to pit the mundane against the monstrous, the opulent against the grotesque, the symbolic against everything else, and shows us how many layers of meaning a meal can hold.</text></scrape>
