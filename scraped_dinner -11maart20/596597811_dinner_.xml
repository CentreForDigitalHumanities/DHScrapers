The premise appealed to me. I like dark. I like the idea of two families covering up their teenaged sons' transgression. I liked Gone Girl. Unlikable characters aren't a big issue for me as long as they're sharply drawn and believable--which for me these people weren't. The dialogue is incredibly stilted. Why do they meet at a restaurant to talk about something that they are all invested in hiding? It presents as psychological realism--I think--but to the best of my knowledge there is no neurological condition like this one (some sociopath gene? that would be convenient) that can show up on prenatal tests. That's just bogus science and yet it's a huge part of the novel and really bugged me. I didn't find the ending shocking or surprising. I felt like it was leading there the whole way. The other mother--Babette--is supposed to love her adopted son (Faso) but never seems to think that she needs to protect him, when everything in me realized where that was going from the moment he first came up. I also feel like it's preposterous that the Dutch police couldn't have found these boys after the video footage including their names was on Youtube. Many holes in the plot, but there were gaping holes in the plot of Gone Girl too, and there they bothered me less because it was more of a romp whereas this was a drag. Enough on the big plates and the tiny, overpriced food, and the "people who believe in global warming." At least Gillian Flynn's protagonist was a charming sociopath. This guy was a boor *and* ultimately a bore, as well.</text></scrape>
