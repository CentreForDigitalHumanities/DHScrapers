I won’t say which restaurant, because next time if might be full of people who’ve come to see whether we’re there.” The book begins ordinarily enough but 50 pages in, it is clear that this will be no ordinary dinner. Paul and Claire are meeting Serge and Babette at an upscale restaurant in Amsertdam where Paul clearly does not want to go. Paul has clear disdain for his brother, the restaurant and just about everything else other than his wife and son Michel. As the story progresses, there is nothing mundane in this family’s “Girl on a Train” meets “Gone Girl” relationships. Throughout the novel the description of the food mirrors the personalities of those eating it. “The first thing that struck you about Claire’s plate was its vast emptiness. Of course, I’m well aware that, in the better restaurants, quality takes precedence over quantity, but you have voids and then you have voids”.I read this book knowing almost nothing about it and I don’t want to give away any spoilers. I read it in two days and could not put it down. I needed to see how the story would unfold and was surprised until the very end!</text></scrape>
