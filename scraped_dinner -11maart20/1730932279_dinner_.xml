I cared about the characters' relationships and was compelled to find out what happens to them. This is a hard book to put down because you want to find out what happens next. The story is told by the father of a troubled youth and his story is unveiled over the courses during an evening dinner with his wife and another couple who's son is also involved in the "trouble". Witty, funny, disturbing, compelling. Herman Koch is an author who keeps you guessing and hints at the mystery surrounding the drama during each course.</text></scrape>
