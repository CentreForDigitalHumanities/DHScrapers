However, I reserve that rating for the truly ridiculous and poorly written novels. The kind that you want to collect all copies and put them in a large bonfire to save humanity from their dribble. This book wasn't quite there.I have seen people review this book comparing it to The Slap because all of the characters are so unlikeable. The difference is though, that in The Slap, each characters reasons and backgrounds are explored and reasoned. This book does not do that. It is true that all the characters in this novel are completely unlikeable and unrelateable, but the book is told from one POV (point of view) from probably the least likeable of a bad lot and is often uncomfortable and sickening to read. There is not alot of exploration into the other characters and the review of the main character's motivations are told through alot of "flashbacks" which I often find is a lazy way to write.Some people also review this book comparing it to Gone Girl. I think that is a very poor comparison as GG is a wild ride through twists and turns and Gillian Flynn deftly turns the reader's opinions of the characters in the book often throughout the story. The Dinner is not even close to this.The much used Tolstoy quote in this book "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" seems to be Herman Kock's inspiration for the story. I can appreciate what he was trying to do, taking a slice of society and a "happy family" at dinner and show their underbelly. It just didn't work for me. There needs to be some level of engagement or suspense for the reader to care what is happening and I just didn't. It also needs to be realistic, and heading for a very expensive dinner with a public figure to talk about a very private family matter didn't ring true for me. </text></scrape>
