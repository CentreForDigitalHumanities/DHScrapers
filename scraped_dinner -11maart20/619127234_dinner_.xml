I didn't hate it in the same way I hated Gone Girl, since I know that comparison is inevitable. The Dinner doesn't go far enough in any direction to be inspire my hatred. The descriptions of the food in the fancy restaurant were supposed to annoy me, I think, but it kind of made me hungry. The characters were unreliable and unlikable, but my feelings for them never reached the intensity of my feelings for Amy & Nick. There is this major conflict at the center of the plot - to what extent will these parents go to preserve their children? It's a compelling idea, but the way it unfolded was less interesting than Gone Girl. At the end of the day, this book is blah for me. I didn't appreciate the European subtlety in this instance. I hope it doesn't go far in the Tournament of Books. </text></scrape>
