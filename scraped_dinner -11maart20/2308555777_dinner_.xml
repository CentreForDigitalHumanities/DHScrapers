What I felt was apathy. I just wanted it over; the dinner, the story, all of it. I feel numb cause I don’t condone any of it or understand people like these that do. The other thing is WHY is this considered a Best Seller? It’s garbage!!! I wouldn’t have these characters over for dinner at all. I wouldn’t even be associated with them, period. I don’t get it. Time to find something enjoyable to read to get these characters off my mind and off my palate so to speak. </text></scrape>
