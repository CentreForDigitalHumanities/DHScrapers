Frankel</author><rating>did not like it</rating><text>I'd heard about this novel from an acquaintance of mine and decided to check it out. Sorry I did. Told from the ol' unreliable first-person narrative, it details a horrific act committed by the narrator's son along with the son of his brother. The narrator is a schoolteacher, his brother a powerful politician.While this novel purports to show the hypocrisy that the fashionable and powerful elite live with, indeed all people live with, the characters are so unlikable, so hypocritical, and the premise so unbelievable in its own way, that I couldn't get into it at all. It turns out all the family members have skeletons to hide, and they're just as homicidal in their tendencies as their children are. Koch may have been skewering the elite, but a couple of things that made me go "WTH" stood out.One, they're in an upscale restaurant, discussing a crime. Discussing a sickening act in the open, so everyone can hear it. Gee, maybe incriminating evidence is allowed to be spoken of because the speakers are wealthy. Do the American elite speak so openly of committing crimes? Maybe they do...Two, we hear of a medical condition--tiny spoiler here--that is not only unbelievable in its own way, it's written about in such a fashion that made me go "WTH" a second time. It seems that a headshrinker warned the narrator of this tale not to father children as he could pass his homicidal tendencies onto his progeny. Is everything that neat and tidy? I doubt any psychiatrist or psychologist would phrase it that way much less make that kind of diagnosis. I know this novel has gotten a boatload of fine reviews and will probably become a movie at one point in the future, but really, it's a disturbing, sickening read to this reviewer if to no one else. In its favor, it does build the suspense, and I read until the end to find out the real reason behind the madness. I shouldn't have.One star, because half-stars aren't allowed. </text></scrape>
