The narrator’s son and his cousin, both upper class Dutch teenage boys, kill a homeless woman and a CCTV video is circulated in the news, whereby their faces are not distinguishable by anyone other than their parents. All 4 parents meet to discuss about the right course of action over dinner.As the narration goes forth, you realize that both parents of the one kid - the more enthusiastically violent -, which, mind you, hasn’t really been feeling remorseful, are seriously messed up and have more or less acted as examples for such behavior. In their effort to conceal their child’s involvement, they resort to more violence. The disturbing thing is the way this point of view is presented be the writer, who is the first person narrator/messed up father. Is the writer trying to justify this kind of behavior? Or is he just exhibiting a case of criminal minds, asking the reader to pass their own judgement? Or is this just a Stephen King kind of thriller with nothing to read between the lines?The first third of the book was an excruciating continuous jealous bitter ramble of the narrator against his politician brother, which was unpleasant and tedious. Concerning the writing abilities of the author, I’d say they are existent and that I read the book pretty fast and found it interesting in a way, albeit weird and as I said, disturbing.I very rarely get such feelings from a book and I would say that all in all I don’t really recommend it.</text></scrape>
