In the meantime we have Paul's stiletto narration puncturing pretentiousness, complacency, Netherlands society and politics, and a few other subjects which come to his mind.We learn what it is the boys have done before the discussion, so this focuses on what the parents intend to do about it. At this point the story becomes very dark and disturbing, which even compared to the boys actions is very dark indeed. I will not give any spoilers, but will say that it is best not to view the book as simply a thriller.</text></scrape>
