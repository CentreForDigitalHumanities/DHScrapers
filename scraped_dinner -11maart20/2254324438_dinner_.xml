I suppose I went in without any expectations at all. It was a page-turner for sure. Gripping me, and compelling me to keep reading. For that I considered giving it 5 stars. But when it was done, and I reflected back, I felt the author used too many convenient and somewhat annoying narrative devices that I at one point thought the book was more deserving a 3 star rating. In the end though I thinks itâ€™s a solid four. You should read it.</text></scrape>
