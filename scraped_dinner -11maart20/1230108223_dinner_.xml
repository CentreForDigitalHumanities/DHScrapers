As a parent I tried to put myself in the characters' shoes and honestly decide what I would do in this scenario. For me the moral of the story is that it's easy to judge others, but when you are actually face to face with the same issues, the line between what is wrong and right may not be quite as apparent. I was super excited to read this book, and although it was a great page turner it didn't blow my mind. 3.5 stars. </text></scrape>
