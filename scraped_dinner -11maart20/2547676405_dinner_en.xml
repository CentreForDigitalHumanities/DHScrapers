I've heard from multiple directions that all four of our dinner guests -- Paul and Claire, Serge and Babette -- are despicable people, and the unspoken suggestion is that to admit anything resembling admiration or affinity for, or empathy with any of this quartet (and especially any of their opinions) is to reveal oneself as despicable. Perhaps that's so.But even the most despicable folks can, from time to time, have a quality that deserves admiration or is a quality one might share with them, or they can be understood by imagining oneself in their place. That doesn't mean we have to see them as anything less than they are, but it does require us to consider them with an open mind and to accept that no one is purely good or bad.The Dinner, it seems to me, challenges us to accept our disdain then look past it at the mirror that is these people. What we find in that mirror is Howard Koch's point. I am sure what one sees is different for every one. Except for those who will claim that they can't see anything of themselves in these characters. For those bullshit artists, for those "pure" souls, there can be only be the fogged up mirror of their self-reflection. They will see nothing but judgment, and they will walk away from The Dinner without learning anything about themselves or our tribal civilization. C'est la vie. </text></scrape>
