I suppose I could consider that, but these people are psychopaths, so it is not a stretch to imagine that two psychopaths might have a child who is a psychopath. Once I realized there was absolutely nothing relatable about the 4 parents seated at the dinner table, no reason to sympathize with their dilemma, I actually found myself more curious about how they might resolve the issue. Who can predict just how far a psychopath would go for their child? </text></scrape>
