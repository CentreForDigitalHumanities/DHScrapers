Instead, it stabs you in the gut.It begins innocently enough with a dinner at a very exclusive restaurant with two brothers and their wives, and you believe you will be reading a light-hearted novel with sarcastic, funny jabs between brothers and silly descriptions of little morsels of food on vast empty plates, until…….I've read horror novels that aren't as terrifying as this--in its bleakness, in its refusal to give you any room to breathe. Koch has created a marvelously unpredictable narrator, and a black-and-white novel that's full of controversy, humor, irony, and despair. It's not violently graphic by any means, but THE DINNER still comes off as a violent book; it's not for the faint of heart.Brilliant, but heartbreaking in concept. </text></scrape>
