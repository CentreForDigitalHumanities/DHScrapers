I read through quite a few and was shocked by the comparison to Gone Girl, of all things. Ummm... Not only do I think they're not similar in tone and purpose, but I actually think it's like saying that Jane Austen's "Emma" resembles Amy Heckerling's "Clueless", but not as good. Seriously, The Dinner was first published in 2001. In The Netherlands, which is a small country in Europe. Europe is an entire continent (well, theoretically speaking) comprised of countries that are widely different in language, customs, political systems etc - and also similar in a few respects, as well. That was a necessary explanation for some of the reviewers, who, I'm sure, had no idea.The Dinner is a spectacular book about family and society, among other things as well. I don't claim to have understood it better than others, I just do not think it was written with the purpose of having the reader fall in love with the characters. This is not a cute book. It's heavy because it's about heavy things, and because it doesn't take heavy things lightly.***some spoilers here***I liked the progression from bland dinner table conversation, pigmented with hints of a couple of mysterious incidents (something found in the phone of Paul's teenage son; Paul's sister-in-law arriving for dinner with traces of tears in her eyes), to the unfolding of the drama behind the dinner. The drama that started years before with instances of personal drama and of parenting; the drama that spikes in a horrific incident, then again in discussing it at home, then again at the dinner table. I liked the progressive revelation of the narrator's character - at the same time neurotic, conservative, fascist, observant - and the increasing urgency of the narration.The fact that this is a Dutch novel is extremely relevant, since Dutch society seems to struggle with a very tolerant front which sometimes comes up to kick itself in the teeth. It is amazing what torments hide behind the blandness of equality and tolerance - not that they always turn violent, but that fear of speaking up against indiscriminate equality becomes oppressive in itself. The violence that accumulates in the over- and undertones of the story is all the more shocking."The Dinner" is a painful analysis of society and family, delivered not from a high moral standpoint, but with a subtle understanding of nuances, of small things that make up or break up lives and relationships.</text></scrape>
