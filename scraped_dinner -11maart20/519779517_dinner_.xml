Amy, don't read this full review if you have any interest in reading the book (i hid the parts that you shouldn't read). everyone else, i don't really spoiler it, but i spoil too much for Amy. ok...moving on.(view spoiler)[oh how i love the unreliable narrator. the narrator who at first, you kind of like, laughing at his jokes, agreeing with his commentary. the narrator you feel compassion for -- his story and opinions. the narrator that throws everything on it's head as the story progresses and makes you feel almost angry at yourself for feeling the way you did in the beginning of the novel. when the truth is actually laid out there and you see what he was saying all along.the back story of "the dinner" unfolds itself in quite an interesting way. over courses of dinner in a ridiculously fancy restaurant, through flashback and phone conversations and YouTube videos, through the thoughts and beliefs of this man, this ex-teacher, this husband, this father. but this story, remember, is also told by someone who has his own agenda, his own self interest, his own background. it all culminates to a very interesting finale. and yes, it's after dessert.  (hide spoiler)]this book is DARK. i mean...like....really really dark. in a long while i haven't read anything this shocking. its full of people you won't like...full of scenes you won't ever want to read again (and won't soon forget). i think the pacing of this novel was really well done. to use a food metaphor (this is "the dinner" after all), the unfolding of each layer of the onion brings out new facts, new understandings, and therefor new questions. there was a perfect amount of the "now" and the "before". a perfect amount of insight, introduced course by course. ***one thing i will say is that this book is NOTHING like Gone Girl. i dont know why so many people are comparing the two. i mean, i've read no less then 5 books in the past year that have so called 'twist' endings...and none of them can be compared to one another. so...if you liked GG, you may not like this...and if you hated GG, you may still love this -- so don't take that comparison as your judge. just read it.***</text></scrape>
