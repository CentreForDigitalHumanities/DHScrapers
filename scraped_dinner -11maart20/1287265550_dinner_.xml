But then you get to know the characters. And as the plot moves along, it gets more and more boring, and the characters get less and less likable. The ending seemed...false. And forced. And morally, I hated every single person in this book.

I wanted to see what it was all about, and I have to say, I was not impressed.</text></scrape>
