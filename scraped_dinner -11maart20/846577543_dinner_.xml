It was a very quick read. I felt the book was very disjointed for me. They take you back to the past but don't finish what happened in certain sections to help you with the present. For example: what was wrong with his wife that she was in the hospital and so sick with many operations? The author puts in things that seem pointless to me or goes on about details that seem overboard. Perhaps I just missed it on this book. Not sure. It was an interesting premise but I was lost in translation so to speak</text></scrape>
