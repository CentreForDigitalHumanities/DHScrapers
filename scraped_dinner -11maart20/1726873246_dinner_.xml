I knew the premise going in but I was not expecting to be so immersed in its pages until I finished it in one sitting. I'm wondering how best to describe its genre, it felt like a thriller/mystery with strong psychological suspense. There were also very sharp moments of black humor throughout and the story built up into a very uncomfortable place that nonetheless kept me glued to the pages. This is not a book you want spoiled so I don't want to say anything else but it was so worth it . The writing and plot twists were incredible.</text></scrape>
