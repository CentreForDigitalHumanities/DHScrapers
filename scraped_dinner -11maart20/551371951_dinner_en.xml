It starts off very readable and I was quickly hooked. But around two thirds of the way through it suffered from what felt like a gimicky device to explain Michelr's behaviour and Paul's attitude. This was the same type of turn off for me as the "explanation" in The Silent Wife. It would have been far more interesting to have the four parents' struggling to deal with their sons' behaviour without some kind of pat -- and yet obtuse -- medical explanation.</text></scrape>
