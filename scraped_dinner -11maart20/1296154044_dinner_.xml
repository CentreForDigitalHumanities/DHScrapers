A very dark story where I hated pretty much every character in it, but it was one of those "I love to hate those people" kind of book. My only problem with it was that the main "mistery" that the story revolves around was very predictable from the start, but it was still really enjoyable to read. Also I LOVED the ending!(view spoiler)</text></scrape>
