Of course this has been done before, for example, Ian McEwan’s Saturday was a book about one day.The technical problem with a limited time scale for a writer is that the majority of the book becomes back-story, which is famously difficult to write without boring the reader (which is a sin).Herman Koch did this brilliantly with the help of another writer’s device – the unreliable narrator. Oh, how I love an unreliable narrator!Two brothers and their wives are having dinner. Quite early on we learn that one of the brothers, the narrator, does not particularly like his older – and more successful – sibling, and is more than reluctant to attend the dinner in a posh restaurant, rather than in ‘the café opposite where ordinary people eat’. But the family get-together is not just for pleasure. The brothers and their wives have something important to discuss; a matter which they manage to avoid until dessert. By the time they come to dessert, though, the reader already knows the seriousness of the situation. At this point, about three quarters through the book, I found myself picking up my Kindle at every opportunity to find out what happens next. I kept worrying about the people in the book as if I knew them.The Dinner is a roller-coaster of a novel. You read it with you heart in your mouth, fearing for, and loathing, the narrator in equal measure. But as well as an good read, The Dinner addresses some important moral issues. How do we deal with social injustice, homelessness and mental illness? These are the serious flaws of our time which the author gives us as if on a plate, serving them up to us and asking, 'What do you think about this?'I am off to find Koch's previous novels.</text></scrape>
