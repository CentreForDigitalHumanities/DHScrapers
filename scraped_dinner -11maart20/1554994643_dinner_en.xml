"The Dinner" takes place in contemporary Amsterdam and events unfold in a matter of hours. Very dark and yet there is something within the pages that kept me hooked. I've noticed a few readers mention, Paul, our narrator being rather unlikeable, but I never felt that it was necessary for me to have sympathy in relation to their lives, only empathy. A rather strange feeling since I often feel the need to connect with a character. I imagine that I'll be mulling over this book for a long time.</text></scrape>
