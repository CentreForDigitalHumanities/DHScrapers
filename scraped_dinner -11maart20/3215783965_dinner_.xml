It wasn’t what I expected at all and I truly had no idea where it was going or the journey the book was going to take me on. I’ve heard very high praise for this book, so I was so excited to pick it up!The book is really about a father, his wife, his brother, and his brother’s wife. They all decide to go to a family dinner and a crazy expensive restaurant to talk about something you learn about slowly. Peppered throughout the book are things that happened in the distant past, the near past, and just recently, that all blend together to create the current story.Without spoiling it, this book left me feeling confused, horrified, and a little sick. It wasn’t necessarily gruesome, but some horrible things happened and were treated like they were nothing. The book was really about flawed characters and the flow of life. It looks at the question of how far we’d go to protect our children, and where our children learn their own behaviors. In the end, I really enjoyed the journey the book took me on. I loved the story and the way the book mirrored the dinner the family was having. I didn’t find any of the characters likable AT ALL, and so I have to give this book 3.5 stars. </text></scrape>
