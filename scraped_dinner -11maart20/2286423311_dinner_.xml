Was listening to it on audio and with 4 hours left I just could not do it anymore. I disliked everything about it, heck I listened to commercials on the radio with more enjoyment. Skipped to the end to find out what happened and bagged it. Life’s too short and I have too many other books waiting to spend anymore of my precious time struggling through this one.</text></scrape>
