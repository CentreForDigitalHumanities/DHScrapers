  Summer House with Swimming Pool
, fellow reviewer Brona noted that my description of that book mirrored her own to The Dinner, Koch's first successful book (and first to be translated into English). Now that I've read both, I would have to concur that they share similar themes and ideas, from the compelling yet morally unpleasant male narrator to the confronting scenario of protective fatherhood versus wanton violence. The Dinner, in 'real time', takes place over the course of a dinner at a fancy restaurant, but within this present-day setting - structured over a five-course meal - the narrator, Paul, takes us back through recent events so that we slowly build a fuller understanding of just what the tension and undercurrents are at this dinner. Paul and his wife, Claire, are dining with Paul's politician brother, Serge, and his wife, Babette. Serge is a virtual shoe-in for next Prime Minister of the Netherlands, and something of a celebrity - incurring Paul's annoyance and envy. The last thing Serge would want on the eve of an election is a scandal, but that's exactly what is brewing: a scandal centred around Serge and Paul's sons, Rick and Michel, and the murder of a homeless woman.This social realism story is a deceptively simple one: it's not about solving a mystery so much as delving into some pretty dark neuroses at both the individual level - Paul, we slowly discover, has some kind of mysterious (unrevealed) condition and is prone to moments of violence - and at a social one. How we care for each other, the divisions of class and wealth, expectations of parents and children, how we interact and socialise. The ethical dilemma at the heart of this book gives it great thrust, and is sure to unsettle and disturb any reader - thus providing much food for thought.Read in July 2016.</text></scrape>
