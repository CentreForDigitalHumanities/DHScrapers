It is not a "feel good book" but if you think about it aren't there a lot of great books that also have those two elements in them? This didn't get 4 stars from me because it simply took too long in my opinion to get going. I felt that parts of it just dragged along. When I hear people compare this to "Gone Girl" I can see where that comparison is coming from but for me this didn't quite have that same fast paced, edge of your seat intensity I felt when I read "Gone Girl." Having said that, still a good read if you are in the mood for this type of story. </text></scrape>
