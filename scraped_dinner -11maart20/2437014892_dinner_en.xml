I loved this. The concept was perfection. An entire family drama told over the (many) course(s) of one fancy dinner. First I want to shout out to the writing in this. Superb. It was stark and visceral at times, smugly maniacal at others, and low-grade hilarious throughout. The human element was constantly present on the page. It scared me, how much I agreed with the narrator about some of his deepest thought traps (no, not all of them!!!! I don’t need admitted.) I particularly loved the analogies and metaphors. These comparisons hit me at a mind-twin level. Herman, my man, you are a master at this.This was melodramatic and over-the-top extra in the best ways. Not one of these characters are likable, but I hope I’m not alone in saying they’re (sometimes) relatable? This book is on the dark charcoal side of the “morally gray” spectrum. (Wait what does this say about me that I can relate to these degenerates? I think I need Shane Dawson to do an investigative docu-series on me.) If you’re looking for some darkness, some black humor, and a lot of expertly paced suspense, this is for you. Perhaps the only thing missing was a little clarity. I found the purposefully vague nature of the narration intriguing for the most part, but other times it led to confusion. I also found the lack of character/plot development a bit disappointing. It makes sense, considering the overall direction of this novel. But some sections were so well-developed in a stream-of-consciousness way for our narrator, that I expected the full novel to also be this developed. And it wasn’t. And that’s okay. But it’s also why I can’t rate it higher. This book was cool. It will freak you out. I’m recommending it.</text></scrape>
