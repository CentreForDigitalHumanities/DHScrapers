Honestly, I knew very little about this book before starting it, and I would 100% suggest others do the same. All I knew was that it chronicled a dinner between two couples who need to discuss something dark going on with their children. Being so unaware going in to this book really helped build tension, and gave me a feeling of increasing unease and horror as I slowly realized the truth of what had transpired, the disturbing opinions of the narrator, and the even more upsetting "conclusion" to the problem. I've read several reviews from people frustrated that the narrator is so unlikeable. While I definitely agree that he is, at the beginning of the book his opinions were kind of relatable, and are slowly revealed to be more and more extreme. I actually thought this was really masterfully done-- to make this narrator seem like a levelheaded character you relate to, and then to slowly reveal him to be a truly disturbed and disturbing individual was the most striking part of this novel. I also did not mind that you kind of hate all of these characters by the end- I was so invested in seeing the story through that I did not find it difficult to read at all. I will say that there is a lot of exposition though and there were portions that I felt myself skimming through (i.e. descriptions of the food, lofty explanations of the layout of the restaurant and the path surrounding it). This book was very scary in a way that kind of reminded me of American Psycho, but even MORE disturbing to me because as I mentioned above, I did immediately realize how unhinged our narrator was, and that slow reveal was very unnerving. I also found it particularly upsetting because the act committed by the sons is simultaneously so disturbing and realistic... but would hardly be a blip in the dumpster fire that is the current horrible and largely desensitized climate in America with respect to attitudes on violence. Will definitely be thinking about the issues raised in this book for a little while. Would recommend to those interested in a kind of claustrophobic-feeling slow-building and unsettling read involving interesting but inherently unlikeable characters that explores issues of what we would do for those we love and the effect of violence on a family. </text></scrape>
