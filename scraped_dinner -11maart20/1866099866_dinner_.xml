I picked it up because it's going to be made into a movie and ya know sometimes I like to read those ones. :) It's a small book but it took me FOREVER to finish it, because I would read a chapter and just felt sort of a sick feeling in my stomach, would put it down and pick it back up a few weeks later. Now, keep in mind I watch ALOT of True Crime mystery shows... Dateline, 20/20, I totally binged "Making a Murderer" and "Did O.J. DO it ?" Like, I watch this stuff ALOT! I literally have I.D. channel on 24/7 in my house, but I DID NOT like this book! I really didn't! I thought he was a great writer, but just SOMETHING about the book didn't click with me...Herman Koch is a good storyteller , I just did not like the story he was telling. It brings up alot of questions, and I think it would make a heated discussion. Here's the jist: and it does contain spoilers... if anyone actually cares. Two couples meet for dinner to discuss what their teenage sons did and how to go about dealing with it. What they did is commit murder. Horribly. They killed a homeless woman. They threw stuff on her, and set her on fire, and filmed it. It's then on You Tube, and one father recongnizes them. One of the kid's dad thinks that maybe murderous thoughts and tendancies might be hereditary.(which brings up a slew of other questions and chapters) "Would he of suggested to his wife to abort their son if they knew?") ... because you see... THIS father has wanted to kill people before, AND he seriously wounded the school principle once (while smiling at his son out the window,) because said principle had issues with a paper the boy wrote. (and of course the dad wrote most of it)The paper was on Capitol Punishment, It raises the question.. is C.P really worth the strain on the government's resources and money to provide for criminals? or, Would we be better off if civilians took care of some of these criminals ourselves, on the street?This guy ALSO thinks that maybe the Holocaust was a good thing, because it took care of some criminals amongst the bunch too. He says: "yeah alot of innocents were killed, but based on the sheer number of people massacred, there had to be some bad apples in the bunch too, right?"In the end. one couple wants to come clean with what their son's have done, one couple does not. and it's left up to the someone to silence them. Very disturbing, but 2 stars for the writing. Probably should of just did 1</text></scrape>
