What an unbelievable, unpalatable pile of crap. I would not recommend this to anyone. If you want a well written "what would you do for your child" book, I highly recommend All is Not Forgotten by Wendy Walker or Defending Jacob by William Landay.First of all, this book has zero likeable characters. Infact, they are hateable characters. All of them. It's hard to read through a book when every single character is an awful human being. You aren't rooting for anyone throughout this story. The author tries to play the "how far will you go as a parent to protect your child" card but it just doesn't work. Every character is an arrogant, wealthy, entitled shitbag. The events in this book are so unrealistic. One thing after another with no consequences. *** Spoilers ahead ***  A long rant since I have literally just put down the book and still heated.I understand that the author was trying to show the ugly side of protecting your children. However it didn't work for me. The father was a violent, mentally disturbed man. The son clearly inherited his father's mental issues. The mother was, to me, the most disturbed of all. A healthy minded woman who just complacently stood beside her dangerous men. She knows her son has a pattern of hurting strangers and getting pleasure out of it. She knows her husband is just as violent and in fact enjoys that characteristic about him. The "how far will you go" card only works if there is a moral dilemma. You are supposed to be torn between the right and wrong thing to do. However for this disturbed family, there is no remorse. In fact, the entire family talks about the homeless woman as if she deserved it. Each one of them said multiple times she shouldn't have been sleeping in the way of the ATM and how horrible she stunk. No reader is going to connect with that. That's not a justification for the boys' action. That doesn't give us a moral dilemma where their actions were semi justified. They reserve a table at an elite restaurant to discuss their son's heinous crime? Really. A high profile place with lots of witnesses, people who could potentially overhear to "resolve" the situation. Makes no sense. So many events in the book were far too unbelievable. The father beats his son's principal to a bloody mess at the school and just doesn't serve jail time? Especially after he was let go from his job and required a psychiatric evaluation. There was no repercussion for that? Attacking a shop owner, no jail time or anything. ðŸ™„ Not how the real world works.How many people are going to "forget " their phone. I will admit, this probably only annoyed me lol. But seriously, first the son and then the sister in law. Snooping through the son's phone is what started all of this. That part didn't annoy me. It was the sister in law accidentally leaving hers behind that drove me nuts. More snooping through someone else's left behind phone. It just seems like lazy, shallow writing. Trying to find a way to make everything unfold easy. The ending is pure shite. The mayor's son goes missing and that's that. We're to believe two hot headed, disturbed teenagers can kill and dispose of a body without a trace. Get the F outta here. The mom basically tells her son to murder his cousin, he does and not a sliver of evidence is left behind. So the boys record themselves beating a homeless man, have been caught on camera killing a woman, now kill again and not once are they suspected of crimes. The father and son just laugh it off at the end. Talk about an unpleasant ending. Total garbage. 10 out of 10 do not recommend. The movie has a really bad rating on IMDB so I assume it's just as bad as the book.</text></scrape>
