I thought I was getting into a snarky satire on the whole foodie culture. I am a foodie, but sometimes we can be so pretentious. C'mon, should we really be posting 10 pictures of food we just ordered to friends and family? Some of these family members don't get Christmas cards from me, but they will get 3 pictures of that brussels-sprouts salad with bacon and a rare mountain goat cheese sprinkled over arugula and other spring vegetables I just ordered from that restaurant that has a 3 week waiting period for a table of 2! But, no! This book starts with the snarky foodie observations. But, it makes an abrupt left turn about 25% through the book and the whole tenor changes. The main course now becomes a macabre murderous psychological story about a family in real crisis. I did not see this coming. I was still eating the brussels-sprouts salad!I could not put the book down. The author digs into a character study about the two brothers, their wives and young sons. The story jumps back and forth over time to define the dysfunctional elements of the narrator's personality. It is chilling. When I finished the book and finally put it down, I was almost shaking. I couldn't believe what I just read. I don't want to give too much away about this thriller. I just want to say, you will never look at the brussels-sprouts salad quite the same! </text></scrape>
