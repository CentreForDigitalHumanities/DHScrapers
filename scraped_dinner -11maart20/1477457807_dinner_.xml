It takes way too long to get into that and causes you to just listen to the annoying and awful and whiny narrator without anything actually creating interest in him or why he is having dinner.The writing is good, the twist (well the entire plot but I am calling it a twist because it is unexpected and you don't learn about it until halfway through the book) is good, and the debates about family are good. I think Koch did a really good job at what he was trying to do. Unfortunately for me, what he was trying to do is not something I am interested in.I would rate this 3 stars based purely on quality, but I personally found it a struggle. If I hadn't been driving 6-7 hours over Christmas/New Years, there is no way I would have bothered finishing this.</text></scrape>
