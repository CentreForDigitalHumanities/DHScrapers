It didn't have one likeable character. I believe the book description said something along the lines of "can't put it down". I feel mixed on that. I had no trouble putting it down and tucking it away for a few days and, at the same time, I didn't want to put it down just so I could finish the darn thing and be done with it.</text></scrape>
