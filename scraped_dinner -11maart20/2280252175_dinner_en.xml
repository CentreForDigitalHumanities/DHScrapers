Everything is viewed from the perspective of one of them, Paul, who depicts his table mates and especially the absurd etiquette of the restaurant in a merciless way. At first this is reasonably satirical and witty (it's been a long time since I've had to laugh so much while reading), but regularly the comments of Paul get a nagging edge. Especially his brother, a well-known politician and probably the prime minister-to-be, is described rather cynically. So, the first parts of this book are very nice to read, with psychological depth, and a lot of recognizable humor. But gradually there is a turnaround and the tension increases, we get a very wry story that basically revolves around the problematic behaviour of the children of our dinner guests. It leads to a confrontation around the restaurant table that makes clear who these 4 adult people (the parents) really are and what exactly drives them. It is no surprise that it ends violently.In between, Koch shows through some drawn-out flashbacks (which slow down the pace of the story) that the narrator Paul with whom we had some sympathy in the first part is actually a very different person than we thought he was. The classic unreliable storyteller trick, thus, but then again, in the end things get another twist. Enticing, isn't it? But this book is not just a cheap roller coaster, Koch has certainly tried to put something more in it, with various themes that all revolve around the question: "what is normal, and what is abnormal?" And that plays at various levels: it concerns both the hypocrisy of restaurant etiquette, the tension between married couples, the interaction of the public with celebrities (and vice versa), as well as the strange behaviour of adolescents, the insoluble choice of their parents between self-preservation, protection and social norms, the heredity of violent temper, etc. Not a bad cocktail, indeed. But the story develops with such speed, that I felt that Koch was throwing these themes all upon one heap, in a hurry, and didnâ€™t really work them out. So we are left with quite some loose ends.This novel certainly reads very smoothly, it has the allure of a rollercoaster and it's been a long time since I read a Dutch novel that was not drenched in cynical nihilism. But I think Koch could have done a lot more with this material.</text></scrape>
