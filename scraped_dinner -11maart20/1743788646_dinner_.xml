As a previous reviewer mentioned, in NO circumstance would you discuss such a matter at a nice restaurant--or in public at all! These people were some sociopaths. Not one part of this book was interesting or enjoyable for me. I also particularly disliked that the narrator would talk about something but not mention specifics "because there was no need." Very annoying.</text></scrape>
