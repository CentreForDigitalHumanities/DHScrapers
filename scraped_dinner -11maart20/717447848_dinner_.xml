I was reminded of the time in high school when my Literature class read Shirley Jackson's famous short story "The Lottery," and also of the time a few years ago when I read the novel Me and Emma by Elizabeth Flock. All of these works just left me sickened, disgusted, and just ... mad. "Maybe that is the intent," you may be thinking. "A good piece of literature can be disturbing and leave you feeling ill," you may be thinking. This is true; however, there is disturbing literature and then there is literature that truly disgusts. Literature that you kind of wish you hadn't read. I felt little to no sympathy for any of the characters in The Dinner. I could not identify with their "dilemmas." If you read the synopsis in the book jacket, you learn that the two couples at the dinner each have a fifteen year old son, and that together, these two boys have committed a horrifying criminal act, seemingly without any remorse. "How far would you go to protect the ones you love?" the book asks. A fair question. One that many people have struggled with. However, without giving too much away, the novel goes deeply into the subject of "victims," and that's when I began to lose my patience. "What percentage of victims are actually 'innocent,' and what percentage are just 'bad' or 'worthless' people who pretty much got what they deserved (even though they are technically still victims)?" the book (and the narrator) asks, many times over.The novel's narrator is, for lack of a better term, a very disturbed individual -- a sociopath, even. Someone who, very obviously, considers himself (and his family) to be above the law, untouchable. Even though a part of him is shocked at what the two boys have done, a much bigger part of him considers the boys (in particular, his own son) to be the true "victims." The book is well-written; that cannot be denied. It is a novel that sucks you in quickly and makes you want to continue reading due to the fact that you simply have to find out what on earth can possibly be revealed next. However, it has to be said that these characters and their choices stay with you long after you've read the last page, and not necessarily in a good way. You may find that, once you've finished, you want to forget all about this "Dinner." </text></scrape>
