It's all rather ridiculous if taken at face value, but at the same time managed to be more disturbing to me than, say, Gone Girl. While Gone Girls is an all-around far-fetched situation that is unlikely to arise in real life, The Dinner preys on fears we all have about ourselves and our families. The over-the-topness comes from certain moments, not the inherent situation, and matches the over-the-top fancy dinner that frames the story. While I found the read compelling and difficult to put down, in the end things didn't come together as well as I'd hoped.</text></scrape>
