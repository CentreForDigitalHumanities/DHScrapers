This was possibly the most painful boring book I've ever read. I hate to be rude and feel like I'm disrespecting the author but good lord, that was so hard to even turn a page.
It could have been a great story had we actually gotten to follow the "crime", but it's just the mind of a wack father.</text></scrape>
