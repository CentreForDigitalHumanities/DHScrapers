I had a series of nightmares the night before i finished the book - and one of them was me spinning on the story of The Dinner (wrongly, I might add, but well) and if that isn’t a sign for a gripping book, then i don’t know what is.Technically it is a pretty horrible story, tense, everyone is quite unlikeable - although I changed my opinion on quite a few characters who at first seemed rather decent to me. What would you do if you found out something horrible about someone close to you? It is a brutal story of family, trust and what is right and wrong, told in many clippings and flashbacks that sometimes change your entire outlook. A brilliant example of what a point-of-view narration and an unreliable narrator can do to you.</text></scrape>
