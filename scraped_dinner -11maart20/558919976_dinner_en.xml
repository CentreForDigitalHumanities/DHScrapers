The story unfolds over a restaurant dinner at an upscale Dutch eating establishment. I loved the organization of the story and the forward momentum which had me finishing this short book in just three sittings. I am a consummate foodie and the descriptions of the hypocritical restaurant culture were some of the best parts of the book for me. I also liked the schaden freude social commentary of the Dutch upper-class settling in remote provinces of France, living as islands Dutchmen but not assimilating with the people and French culture which surrounds them. This reminded me of expatriate retirees on islands where I come from in the Caribbean, proving we are all tribal in one way or another.The book was weakest when it dealt with issues of racial and class stereotypes in Europe and its commentary on random youth violence. The book in fact stereotypes urban blacks strictly into two categories: baseball cap-wearing and streetwise, or assimilated white aspirants. Black culture is much richer and diverse from a wide ranging continuum than authors from the outside believe. Far too often both black and non-black authors pigeon-hole blacks, and in particular Africans and African-American, into cultural and behavioral categories which do not do justice to the history, sociology, culture, intelligence, and talents of Afro-centric people worldwide. Although Faso was at higher moral ground than his brother and cousin, I still found Mr. Koch’s commentary on race to be a major flaw perpetuating a racial stereotype.I thought that the hereditary illness of the protagonist and his son were a bit contrived and found it difficult to suspend disbelief. That said, I thought the book was well-written and interesting enough to keep me glued to it over a weekend. I saw glimmers of genius in Herman Koch’s writing—even in translation. However, I think he still seems to be developing as a novelist. My impression is that he is an author more comfortable in the short story, novella, or play script format still trying to find his feet scaling to a full-scale novel.</text></scrape>
