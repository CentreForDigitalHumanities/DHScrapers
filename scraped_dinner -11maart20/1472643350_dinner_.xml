Just when you think it's going to be a normal dinner date between siblings, things turn so very weird. Paul changes as the dinner progresses. You learn more about what makes him tick, what extremes he will go to that will ensure his child will grow up strong and free. I often forgot that this took place in Holland, it could have quite easily have been in Washington. I disliked Serge - he was pompous and a typical politician. Paul - much harder to place. At first he seemed like a pal and soon turned into that type of man who makes you uneasy being in a room with him. The wives - neither of which struck a chord of true people. They both had things to hide and I'm not sure either would have made great besties either. </text></scrape>
