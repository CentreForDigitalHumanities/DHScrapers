With each new course and with it a fresh glass of wine the tempers flare, more secrets are spilled, and we begin to see how far each parent is willing to go to protect their loved ones.This was certainly a wonderfully written, wild ride. It kept giving me flashes of American Psycho meets Polanski's film Carnage. Great detail put into the meal, the unending, stuck-up attitude of the "elite" and of course the mounting tension between each family, desperate to protect their child no matter the cost. Koch uses the meal as his template, each course delivering more layers, unfolding deeper into the backstory until the final coup de grace. You find yourself detesting each character while at the same time being completely absorbed and fascinated by them, a talent not all authors are able to achieve. Very dark, twisted story which won't be for everyone, but those who did enjoy Psycho and Carnage will probably get a lot out of this one as well. Koch has given me a lot to think about, I have a feeling this one will stick with me for awhile.</text></scrape>
