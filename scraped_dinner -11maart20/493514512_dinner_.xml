I was vaguely interested in this and bought it too, and finally got around to it a couple of days ago.It starts out quite intriguing - the whole story is based around a dinner between two couples, with a hidden issue that unravels as the dinner progresses. I did like the way Koch makes the likeable characters completely unlikeable by the end of the dinner, and vice versa. It's an interesting look at parenting and what people do to protect, or teach, their children. A good read - it got a bit tedious at times, but I guess I enjoyed it. As a high school teacher it left me thinking about the way parents often seek to protect their children, sometimes to their developmental detriment. Is the role of the parent to protect children no matter what, even from the consequences of their actions, or to teach them about responsibility, even when those consequences can be life-changing?</text></scrape>
