I'm actually rather disgusted that I spent money on this...There were no characters I liked or felt I could identify with. The approach of having the entire story take place during a dinner was I suppose an interesting tactic, but not believable given the topic they were there to discuss. Paul's constant sulking and ranting narration did nothing to make me want to pick up the book and keep reading. Stories with moral dilemmas can be very thought provoking, but I didn't actually find this to be challenging so much as nauseating. I felt like it was an attempt to be dark and shocking simply for the sake of being dark and shocking. If you're going to present the reader with a situation which causes them to honestly question whether they would *really* "do the right thing," you've got to present a problem that is at least morally ambiguous due to uncontrollable circumstances. There was nothing ambiguous about the morality (or lack thereof) in this story. And neither could I feel any interest or empathy in any of the characters.Frankly, I thought the characters and their actions were loathsome and I can't think of a point in time while reading this book that I felt anything resembling enjoyment or interest.</text></scrape>
