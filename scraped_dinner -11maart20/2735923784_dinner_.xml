It definitely kept my interest and I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened. The story posed an intriguing moral dilemma making the reader wonder what they would do and how far they would go for the benefit for their child. And themselves. That being said, I didn't care for the ending. It left too many unanswered questions in my mind. There really was not a complete resolution to the issue. Due to the unsatisfactory ending and my dislike for most of the characters, I ended up only giving this book 3 stars. Perhaps if the ending had been better I would have kept the 4 stars.</text></scrape>
