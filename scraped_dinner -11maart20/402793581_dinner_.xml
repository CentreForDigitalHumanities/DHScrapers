I thought I hated people in 'The Slap' but not so after reading this. Initially I liked Paul but as the novel continues he really is quite despicable. I guess it ended differently to I imagined. It is a disturbing read but quite telling of human character. I did find myself remembering excruciating family dinners. I'd love to know what others think of the mental illness that Paul suffers from. The lack of any ethical moral considerations for the victim of the boys is truly disturbing.</text></scrape>
