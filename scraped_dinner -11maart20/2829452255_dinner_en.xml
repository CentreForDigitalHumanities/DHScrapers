Really I would have liked to give it 4.5 stars but it is most certainly 4 solid stars. I didn’t rate it 5 stars due to the fact that I did think it drug on a little long in some places and that some of the flashbacks (i.e., Paul’s run-in with Michel’s principal) seemed to bear no consequences.  Paul Lohman and his wife Claire live in Amsterdam with their fifteen-year-old son Michel. Serge Lohman, supposedly a shoo-in for the office of Prime Minister, is Paul’s brother. Paul hates his brother. Serge lives in Amsterdam with his wife Babette and his son Rick and adopted son Beau (nicknamed Faso by his brother and cousin). When I first started reading this book, until about page 76, I viewed it as satire. I laughed at Paul’s description of the absurdities of this high-end restaurant that he and his wife were going to dine with his brother and his wife. I laughed at the “Manager” who gave long descriptions of the food as it is brought to the table all the while pointing to said food inches away from the plate with his pinky finger. Paul’s sarcastic thoughts about it were hilarious to me. Comedic satire it was indeed…….until it wasn’t. The purpose of the dinner meeting is to discuss what actions need to be taken with regard to a very serious matter involving their sons, a crime actually. It seems that the three boys went to a party and after the party was over, stopped at an ATM machine to withdraw some money for one more beer. Something terrible happened at the ATM. I am being very careful not to put spoilers in this review. The way the author laid the story out needs to be experienced by the reader first hand.  On an end note: I hated all four of these characters. Actually, I disliked every character that Mr. Koch introduced in the book, including the sons, the Manager, the owner of the restaurant, the father and daughter who asked for a picture with Serge.That being said, I loved the book. The darkness of the events rolled out in a very timely manner through the flashbacks and the thoughts of Paul, the narrator. I will think about this book for a very long time. Through the flashbacks, the reader begins to understand the four main characters. It is dark, it is haunting, but I loved every word of it. Herman Koch has earned a fan in me. I will be reading his other books as well. This review also appears on my new blog:https://glendareads.comThis is my first blog. If you visit, any suggestions are welcome.
