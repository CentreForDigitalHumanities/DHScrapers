It was easy to get into and made me want to keep reading. Something changed about halfway through. I'm not sure what it was. The characters are all annoying, unlikeable, and boring. The situation between the kids was not even anything shocking as led to believe. This book just seemed pointless to me over all. It was also very unnecessarily descriptive. It took 2.5 pages to explain what the father saw in the bottom corner of a video! It could have been said in one sentence and would have been just as effective. I guess all of those unnecessarily long description were indeed necessary, to write an entire book that takes place during a single dinner at a restaurant. Not a fan of this one. Disappointing.</text></scrape>
