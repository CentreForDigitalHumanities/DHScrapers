The story shifts between the restaurant conversation and the gradual revelation of a secret that has a major impact on both couples. I enjoyed the first person narrator (the male of one of the two couples), who initially has the reader on his side as he discusses the pretension of the exorbitant restaurant. However, the narrator turns out to be a quite different person. The Dinner impressively explores extreme personality disorders as they are passed down between generations. </text></scrape>
