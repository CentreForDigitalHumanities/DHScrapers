The way the story was split by which course of the meal they were on, I just loved the concept. The descriptions of the dinner were wonderful. I enjoyed each character and diving into their separate minds. It was enjoyable the way the book laid out the purpose for the dinner. I was pulled in wanted to know more details of what occurred and to figure out whose side I was on.I very much look forward to reading more Herman Koch in the future. I can only hope more of his works get translated into english for us all to enjoy.</text></scrape>
