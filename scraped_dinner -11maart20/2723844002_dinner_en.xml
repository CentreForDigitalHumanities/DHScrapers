I only finished it because it was so short. The characters are all a bunch of over-emotional, narcissistic sociopaths, and then they wonder why their kids turned out just as stunted as them. It’s also simply badly written, juvenile and simplistic with a lot bonkers philosophical nonsense and no psychological depth. They spend the whole story arguing and fighting and pretending to be better than the other when they’re all condescending tits in the way insecure people like to view themselves above others. Don’t read it unless you like being constantly annoyed at the irrational, rude, childish actions of everyone.‬</text></scrape>
