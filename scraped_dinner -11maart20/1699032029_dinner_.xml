What starts as a seeming comedy of manners spirals into something Stephen King might have written... and you never see it coming.


Ultimately, it is both: an observational tale of staus, class, and the expectations they sow into people's choices and behavior, and an utterly chilling, suspenseful story that comes very close to horror. I loved it.</text></scrape>
