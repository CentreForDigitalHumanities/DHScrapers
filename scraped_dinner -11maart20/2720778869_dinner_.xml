I dont say this about a book very often but I had to force myself to finish this one. The characters were very unlikable and most likely all sociopaths with no empathy for others. Seemed like the only thing they had in common was a willingness to sacrifice another to save face. I am thoroughly disappointed. This book seemed to have rave reviews that led me to shake my head in disbelief and ask if I had been reading the same book as the other people who loved this. Such a bummer.</text></scrape>
