This book did not. The first third I actually liked a lot, as a Bonfire-of-the-Vanities-style lampooning the very superficial/fake politician brother. The middle third got weird, but I was curious how it would work out. The final third was a total 180 in how multiple primary characters behaved, and simply didn't fit, especially the wife also being vile. Not inclined to read any more by this author.</text></scrape>
