So torn. At first I didn't think I would like it, because the summary equates it to Gone Girl and I hated Gone Girl with a fiery passion. But this was not like Gone Girl. I liked the structure, the way the story was framed around a dinner at an extravagant restaurant, the way the book was broken down into the courses of the meal, and the way we found out what had happened in bite-sized portions along the way (pun intended). But I also found pretty much all the characters gag-worthy, a combination of nauseatingly pretentious and just awful people. I have a hard time reading about people with little or no redeeming qualities. I just do. I also didn't like the deliberate lack of specificity about place names, etc. it was a deliberate choice the author made, to give the narrator personality, but every time he said something along the lines of "I'm not going to give the name of X because it's none of your business," it threw me out of the story. And finally I found it incredibly problematic that all of the father's and the son's actions could be blamed on their (again unspecific) hereditary mental illness. So while this book was a fast read and I was sucked in and intrigued by the plot, on the whole I don't think I would recommend it.</text></scrape>
