I didn't want to - the characters we disagreeable and the mood was awful and it seemed like it was just trying to create a bunch of tension with no real story. Then when it got to the point of explaining what their kids did that was so terrible, it just turned my stomach and I had no interest in finding out what the parents decided or what became of the kids. Not my kind of story.</text></scrape>
