In an attempt to get the the "unbelievable ending", I pushed myself to keep reading it. I should have known that I wouldn't have liked this book by the fact that Gillian Flynn endorsed it, and it was marketed as "If you loved 'Gone Girl', you'll LOVE 'The Dinner'!". I wouldn't have wasted my time if I had known that every single character in this book was unlikable in every way. In my humble opinion, it shouldn't be too much to ask for at least one character whom you can sympathize with. I felt no sympathy, empathy, or liking toward anyone in this book. It felt like a forced attempt to write something others would find gruesome. The reality is, the things that most people find to truly be despicable are things that they can imagine happening to them or their friends/family in real life. One and a half stars. </text></scrape>
