I hated the ending with every fiber of my being. I found myself wanting to put it down numerous times, and I felt physically ill when I realized where the ending was going....and yet I didn't hate the book itself. I actually went back and forth about whether to give it three stars or four stars for quite awhile. If it was possible I would give it 3 1/2 stars, so lets just say I did. I am going to leave my review simple for many reasons- 1) You don't need me to tell you what this book is about because there are lots of other people explaining the plot on Goodreads, and they will do it much better than me (writing down my thoughts has never been my forte)... 2) I have just started to voice my opinions on here, and my thoughts on this book would make me sound like a " raving, people hating, I weep for the future" kind of gal...and finally 3) If I get into my feelings of THE DINNER I will probably give something away (since I don't know how to use the spoiler warning yet). I feel to get the most enjoyment out of reading it, you really should go in blind.</text></scrape>
