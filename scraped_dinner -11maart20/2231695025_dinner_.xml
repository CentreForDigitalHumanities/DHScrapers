Throw in a few quite elaborate food details from the waiters and there you have it, The Dinner.Spoiler alert: these couples 3 teenage sons are found to have video footage online of their assault/murder of a homeless woman. This is incredibly disturbing and horrible yet there isn't really a resolution to this crime.. Mostly just the parents deciding to hide it and hope that in 3 months it'll blow over. Ugh. Just awful.</text></scrape>
