Right off, I didn’t really like the narrator. I don’t know why, but I didn’t. Later in the novel, this dislike made more sense. Perhaps because of this, it took me forever to really get into the story. I think I was about 2/3 of the way through before I felt I wanted to stick with reading it.The core of the story takes place over the course of a dinner between two couples at a restaurant. It’s divided into sections: Aperitif, Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert. I found that to be an interesting method of further dividing the narrative, not just by the standard chapter. However, I’m not sure it really added much value to the scope of the novel. The story is told from one view, that of one of the dinner attendees, Paul Lohman. Along with his wife, his brother, and his sister-in-law, the four sit down to eat and discuss their two adolescent sons. There were moments that I found myself quite interested in the scenario, but then Paul would veer off onto some tangent that was only peripherally linked to the present situation. Or so it seemed to me. Some of this tangential discussion was necessary, but for some of it, I found myself wondering what on earth this was all for. Well, I got there in the end.It really was a disturbing story. Time and again, the characters made excuses for bad behaviour and sometimes compounded it by doing something worse. It was also disturbing that Paul constantly described his family as “happy” when they were really anything but. It made me wonder how truly happy some families are, although I don’t think most are quite this awful. I gave this novel three stars, but it’s a weak three.</text></scrape>
