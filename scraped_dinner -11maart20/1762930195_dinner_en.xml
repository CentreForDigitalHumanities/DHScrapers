I have mixed feelings about it though. I didn't like any of the characters, but i guess that is the purpose of the book. It is about a bunch of selfish, self-centered, fascist sociopaths who commit crimes and don't get punished for them, which was the most irritating part for me. The thing is, despite it's nastiness, i couldn't stop reading the damn book! It is one of those stories that makes you think about it quite a while, leaving a bad taste in your mouth that you can't get rid of easily!</text></scrape>
