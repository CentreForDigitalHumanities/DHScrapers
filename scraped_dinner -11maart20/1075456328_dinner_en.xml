Dark, disturbing, well written, page-turner that left me thinking. This is not a book you would want to read on your own, it is a book that must be discussed. I'm so glad that my live book club is reading it, AND that I read it with a GR friend so we could discuss it as we went along. I couldn't help but wonder who would I be more like, Paul and Claire, or Babette and Serge? I know who I'd WANT to be more like but hey, I don't have kids, so who knows?! If you are in the market for a thriller, one that will keep you thinking 'what now?' this is the book for you. But be forewarned it does have some disturbing matter at the heart of it. The ending is not your tidy little everything answered ending either. Quite a few things you will be left wondering about. </text></scrape>
