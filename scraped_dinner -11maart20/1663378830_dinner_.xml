Shocking, I know. Who'd have thought?! Insert a plethora of foodie descriptions; pretentious mind-wanderings of the intensely neurotic and violent, douchebag of a narrator, and you pretty much have the entire story. Perhaps "lack thereof" would be a more accurate description. I started out enjoying this book, however that lasted until roughly the third chapter. Afterwards, once discovering the crime committed by the two children in question - who are cousins, no less - I was in "I hate these kids" mode. (I really don't enjoy books in which I am made to despise children. It just feels wrong to wish criminal punishment on a child.) I finally reached the end of my having anything upbeat to say during the final discussion of the evening when it truly comes out in glaring neon lights what a pack of idiots these parents are. Actually, all but one. One has the right idea; three others are still living in their "We're wealthy therefore consequences shouldn't apply to us" world. I did enjoy some of the juxtaposition used by the author in this book, and I will also give credit to the translator, as translating any other language into English is a feat unto itself. So for certain writing tricks and a good grasp on the Dutch-English relationship, there's the two stars. And not a single extra star was to be had. That said, I will definitely look for other Herman Koch work to read, as I am now curious as to the subject matter and writing style of his other books. </text></scrape>
