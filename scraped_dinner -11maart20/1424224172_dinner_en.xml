As they go through each extravagant, rather absurd course (presided over by a memorable restaurant worker who points at things with his pinky!), we flash back to scenes involving their children. The quartet are dining out to discuss an incident that may affect everyone’s future.Despite the contrived setting – I doubt they would meet in such a public way to talk about such a sensitive, private matter – the book is cleverly constructed. And narrator Paul, a former history teacher who resents his boorish older brother Serge’s political success, plays with our sympathies. At first we’re on Paul’s side; he’s amusing, self-deprecating and his cutting social observations (about the restaurant, about his brother) seem as sharp as a chef's knife. But as the night goes on and he fills us in on his past – and that of his wife, Claire, and his son, Michel – things become more sinister. Then they become downright creepy. The disturbing act at the centre of the book brings up lots of ethical and moral questions, and Koch handles the teasing out of this incident brilliantly. He’s less successful near the end, where he practically rushes through to the denouement. But the jagged little pieces of this narrative fit together into one horrific portrait of family life. I’m definitely going to read Koch’s  Summer House With Swimming Pool.</text></scrape>
