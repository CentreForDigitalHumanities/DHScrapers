It's not a European Gone Girl like the review says, unless just having married characters, or characters with anger issues, engenders that comparison. It was an interesting book, and I enjoyed the way it unfolded along the lines of the dinner (eg, appetizer, main course). The character of Paul is very well done. But it all felt forced and a little over the top. I'm glad it was a library book and not something I bought.</text></scrape>
