This book has more questions than answers, and while I'm looking forward to discussing with my book club, I don't think they'll have different conclusions than I do. We'll see. I really think this book could have been phenomenal if done differently, and if it hadn't been compared to Gone Girl (it's not like that book, and it does the reader a disservice to describe it as such. It makes us wait for a big reveal, it informs us the narrator is unreliable from the start, and it ruins the experience of The Dinner entirely.)Can I say I enjoyed and both didn't enjoy the vagueness of this book!? Why not tell us why Claire was in the hospital? I've seen some reviewers suggest she was getting an abortion (just wrong in my opinion... Three operations for an abortion!?) or that she was hurt by her husband (also wrong, as you'll see in a minute). If she was in the hospital for a mental illness, which would make sense since she is the sociopath, then why would she be having operations? Why would Paul say it was life threatening?Paul's illness is up for grabs too. I've seen reviewers make guesses, but apparently, Koch made up the mental illness as he states in an interview. So, why not make it something real? Also, none of the violent incidents happened in my opinion (the ones by Paul anyways). He's dealing with this intense rage, but he envisions these violent episodes. If he went through with these violent acts (beating his brother with a hot skillet, punching the principal of his son's school), he would have had to serve time, we would see scars on his brother's face, etc. I think the important difference between the narrator struggling with his mental illness, and his son's struggle with his hereditary version of this made up illness, is that the narrator is able to control it. He says once during a rage moment that he thinks about his son and his wife and what it would do to them if he went through with the violence. He even, at the end of the novel, tells Claire that he can't be the one to hurt Serge. I wonder a bit if Paul struggled like Michel did at that age and actually committed violent acts. If so, it would make sense that this character is more accepting of Michel's violence and to ignore it. Other people mentioned that they were confused by other vague pieces of the novel, which I thought were more obvious. The paper that Paul finds with the amino test confirmed that he did in fact pass on his illness to his son and Claire made the decision to keep her son anyways. Beau disappeared, murdered by his cousin. Claire sanctioned and in fact, helped him cover it up. She created an alibi for her son, and probably even told him how to do it. Claire is ill in a way that is far more worrisome than her husband's illness. And the two together created a monster. I think those were pretty obvious conclusions to those pieces of the story.Where I like the vagueness in this novel is more in the details. I like that Paul won't tell us the restaurant name. I enjoy that he can't tell us the name of the female student who complained to the principal. Paul also won't tell us the name of the school (it makes him angry/uncomfortable) or the hospital that Claire visited. I think I enjoyed it because it sort of adds to his unreliability, but in a way that doesn't really impact the plot or the reader's understanding of it.My other real problem with this book is the poor execution. I think that Koch was trying to make a statement through some of the comparisons (middle class vs. poverty, white vs. black, adoption... nature vs. nurture, etc) but he executes it so poorly. I think if the reader wasn't so hung up on trying to discover the truth of the boys' story, the truth about the narrator and Claire, etc, we would be able to see some of these themes more clearly. Of course, there are other slight problems for me in this book. But I did surprisingly find the voice of the narrator and the style of Koch interesting. There's something unique about his writing that I liked. And the concept of the story and the revealing about the characters and their histories over a dinner was perhaps the best part. I liked the side bars about the meal itself, and the narrator reacting to the waitress, maitre d, and all of the pomp of a fancy meal out. That was really well-done. All in all, I just wish the reveal had been more shocking and the author had abandoned some of the mystery behind the story. I think it distracted more than helped this novel... Too many questions without answers really distracted from the finer points of the book. (hide spoiler)]</text></scrape>
