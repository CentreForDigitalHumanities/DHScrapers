Many hated it. I found it thought provoking and controversial. I continued to think about the characters and their actions after the last chapter closed. The book is set basically in one evening with some flashback. Two brothers and their wives are having dinner for the unspoken purpose of discussing horrific deeds committed by their teenage sons and what they should do about it. Many reviews have stated that the book asks "what would you do to protect your child. While it does ask that it also asks how well do we really know our children, our spouses. I also think it makes us stop and think about society's fascination with violence, intolerance and aggression. This book begs for discussion. I would recommend to book clubs for a healthy, provocative discussion. With regard to the writing, I like Koch's style. He does an excellent job of developing the characters in the book and the story moves along at a quick pace. You may not like the characters, but he creates our reaction to them perfectly. I found the book a real page turner--read it in two days.</text></scrape>
