What a collection of nasty people, deeply unsympathetic, every one of them. It's odd for me not to be swept into sympathy with the narrator-I tend to take on their point of view and am very forgiving of their defects. And so it was with the man (husband and father) narrating this story of parental love and madness. Until I found him just too repulsive to forgive. And the mother, slightly more sympathetic but not much. And I forgive a lot done in the name of mother love but, again, she was just too ugly for me to like.But I found the book mesmerizing-I literally read it in one reading; I couldn't put it down. Hard to know what the original prose is like but the translation (from Dutch) is smooth. And certainly the location, the characters and their relationships are artfully drawn.An excellent book. I loved every nasty moment of it.</text></scrape>
