Loved this plot! Finally a thriller that really is a thriller. I didn't want this dinner to end. I enjoyed every second of it. The characters were great and fascinating. The plot was effective and fast paced (read it in two days). I just didn't want this book to end. I will read more books by Herman Koch. That's for sure.</text></scrape>
