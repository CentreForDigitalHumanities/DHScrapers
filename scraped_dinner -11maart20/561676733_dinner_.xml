Does that mean that it was well written? Maybe. But my emotions are getting the better of me.First of all, I don’t know why the reviews call this the European Gone Girl, it’s more like the European Defending Jacob. And Defending Jacob is better (in my opinion). Defending Jacob builds up suspense where this book just gives it to you straight. Kinda dumps the situation (the main course) on you halfway through and the more you find out, the more decisions that get made, the more you feel sick to your stomach. No wonder they didn't eat their desserts...It’s definitely an original concept, having the narrative all take place during one dinner. The parts of the story mimic the courses in a meal. But don’t be fooled. There are flashbacks, lots of random rambling thoughts, and character history here as well. And the more character history that I learned about Paul, the dad, the more I heavily disliked him. Was the fact that he has some disease he never identifies supposed to make it OK the way he lashed out and bullied people in front of his young son? The way he beat people up? His actions and beliefs obviously influenced his son from a very early age to have no respect for society, reminds me of American History X. The father being the influential negative in his son’s life.I completely didn’t agree with the dad and the mom and the decisions they made. Fine, they want to protect their son, but to completely overlook the fact that their son did terrible things? To laugh at what he did to people? Gross. To create more violence on top of more violence? I understand blood being thicker than water and all of that, but I have the moral compass to, at the very least, teach my daughter right and wrong, teach her to respect people. You've gotta take responsibility for your actions. I think this is a good book for people to read. It's original. It offers up a lot of social & moral issues. But it's definitely hard to digest.</text></scrape>
