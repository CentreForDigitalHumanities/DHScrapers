I loved the structure-- the mundane details about the dinner while all four characters were dealing with a life-changing event led to a very compelling story. However, as more of the story was revealed I found the characters themselves to be completely distasteful, and the plot made little to no sense. Without spoiling anything, I'd just like to say that the extreme measure taken at the end seemed to only be for shock value-- in real life, I don't think it would solve the problem, I think it would likely make it worse. </text></scrape>
