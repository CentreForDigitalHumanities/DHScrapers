First off, let me tell you that I feel unsettled. Unsettled and a bit disturbed. But I'll get to that in a second.The Dinner by Herman Koch is all about the way the story unfolds. It begins quietly enough, when two brothers and their wives meet for dinner at a fancy restaurant to discuss an incident that involved their two sons. Although a short book, the story unfolds teasingly over the courses of dinner, reflecting the pace of the fancy dinner, and dramatically revealing more about the story. I won't tell you about the horrifying incident, or the controversial behaviors of some of the characters, but I will tell you that this book will stay with you. It will have you questioning your beliefs and your judgments as important details are slowly revealed throughout the story. This one isn't for everybody. The subject matter is definitely off-putting and makes you feel uneasy. With that being said, I would still recommend it. I'll be thinking about this book for weeks to come. Fans of Gone Girl or American Psycho would probably like this one. </text></scrape>
