This is a very dramatic story aided by terrific audio performers. It deals with serious issues and hooked me from the start, becoming more and more dreadful and intriguing as horrific events took place. But for me, there is more. This author writes with the precision of a surgeon. Many times, characters are ‘developed’ as the story goes along and their actions show us who and what they are. This is different. I feel like the author uses a scalpel to reveal his characters, opening them up to us one bit at a time. Beyond the ‘action shots,’ he skillfully creates tension in small but steady increments and the story becomes increasingly frightening, well beyond the scope of the criminal actions. Is this really ‘just’ a story? My gosh. Definitely a Good One!</text></scrape>
