   "You don't have to know everything about each other. Secrets don't get in the way of happiness."
Though this was not the thriller that I had been hoping it would be, I was still ridiculously enjoyable in a number of ways. The way that Koch keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire novel is no small feat. I think a lot of my issues with it came from some of the translation, and the fact that though the crime was serious, it wasn't as crazy as it was made out to be. I was intrigued by Paul's own background and story, and that he had some unnamed hereditary disease that he passed on to Michel that made them both a little crazy and without remorse or empathy. If the novel had focused on that more, I would've loved it. This was an insane little drama from start to finish though, and I can't say that I wasn't amused and pulled into it all.</text></scrape>
