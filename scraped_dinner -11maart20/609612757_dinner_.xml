Through Paul's eyes, we view Serge, the up-and-coming politician, as a pretentious bourgeoisie who has chosen to dine at a restaurant where he receives a personal welcome from the owner and for which the 3-month waitlist has no meaning. The two couples have gotten together to discuss their common problem - it is their children who are the faceless delinquents caught on videotape and publicly condemned for their inhumane behaviour toward a homeless woman in an ATM cubicle. About halfway through the novel, the reader is clued in to what their sons have done and from then on, the novel delves further and further into the darkness. Paul is not a good man. Neither is Claire (a good woman...). Any sympathy you might have felt for Paul for having to tolerate his brother dissipates rather quickly. You will not like anybody after reading this book. It's dark and unsettling, but not satisfying. Yes, Paul and Claire are acting in what they believe are the best interests of their son, Michel, but the author casually seems to attribute much of the violence to some nameless medical condition instead of really digging and exploring the issue. I felt like that was an easy way out. </text></scrape>
