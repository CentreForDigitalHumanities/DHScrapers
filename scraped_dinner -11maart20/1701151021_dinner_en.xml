What a fun dinner experience that was!Everything was going so well during drinks and appetizers. Just a nice meal in a super fancy restaurant. Luckily, Serge knew people since he was a politician and all, maybe even the next prime minister! The first third of the book was just that... appetizers, whetting my appetite for the delicious main course. Pages and pages of beautiful descriptions, subtle humor, not so subtle humor, and casual conversation. The whole book could have stayed right there and I wouldn't have minded at all. But, ohhh what happened.... We gotta talk about the children. And that's when the main course got really, really dark and you got to know everyone a little too well, more details than you ever wanted to know, stories of the past that shouldn't really be unearthed. Not here, not at dinner. People will say, "Ugh, I didn't like any of the characters. They were all so awful. Boo hoo hoo." I didn't like any of these people either. I was never rooting for anyone. I don't think that's the point of the book. Yeah, it seems absurd that these parents had to make what we may see as easy decisions, right? But, man, we're not running for prime minister, and aren't we all selfish at our core anyway? Doesn't this maybe point out that we're probably always going to look out for ourselves, and isn't that worse? How different am I from these people? Ahhhh!!I loved the twists and turns of the novel, diving into Paul's past and his relationship with his brother. It didn't turn these people into anti-heroes or make me feel for them, but it made them three dimensional even if they were still pretty awful. The way this book took a sharp turn and didn't lay off the brakes from there was fantastic. I didn't think there was a moment wasted, and I loved each section of the meal. I would even argue that it ended a little too abruptly after the slow climb to get there. I would have liked a few more pages, maybe an epilogue or something. I don't know. I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I knocked out most of it in a day. I would definitely recommend it for something a little darker, but please, for the love of God...Don't compare this to Gone Girl.</text></scrape>
