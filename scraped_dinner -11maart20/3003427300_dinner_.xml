Endless, description of memories or events that donâ€™t add anything to the story.
It was dragging on for nothing. I skipped many paragraphes because I was getting board. I would not recommend this book. Some say it is in the same style as Gone Girl. Please do not compare this book to a masterpiece like Gone Girl.</text></scrape>
