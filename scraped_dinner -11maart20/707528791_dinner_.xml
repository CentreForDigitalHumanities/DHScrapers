The characters were un-likable - all of them! I thought it was going to be a tense story about two sets of parents discussing how to handle some trouble their teens had gotten into. Instead, it was just a story about a crazy man. I can usually find some redeeming qualities, but I disliked the characters, the story, the writing, everything! And I was further put off by the author constantly putting things in the story just so he could turn around and say "I'm not going to talk about this.". If you don't want to talk about it, then DON'T. You don't have to put that down on paper. </text></scrape>
