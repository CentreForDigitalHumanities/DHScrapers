Too much dysfunction and no likeable characters. The one character I thought I liked turned out to be one of the worst. The one I didn't like was the most moral.Two brothers and their wives have dinner together to discuss, as it turns out, their sons heinous act. The unreliable narrator, Paul, doesn't like his brother, Spence, who is a politician. The whole story is told from Paul's extremely skewed prospective and though I think it was meant to be funny, I wasn't laughing.</text></scrape>
