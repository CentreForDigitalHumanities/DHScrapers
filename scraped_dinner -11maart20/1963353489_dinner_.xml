I did enjoy the ending and the revelations but I found it was much too slow and tedious for the first half. I immediately disliked the narrative perspective from the first chapter so that didn't help as I usually don't enjoy being sunk into a first person narration with such a negative and toxic character. And I didn't like that one of the key elements in the story is a reference to an inaccurate medical representation. I know that the author has stated that he left it slightly vague and included points that are not possible in our current world, but that makes it worse in my view. The setting is in the real current world and he doesn't make it clear enough in the story itself that these are things beyond what exists in our world.</text></scrape>
