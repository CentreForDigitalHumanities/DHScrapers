I read another book by this author "Summer House with Swimming Pool" and I loved this story. Both books' stories are told by the main character and you get lots of insight into what this person thinks and believes. The first book I read SHWSP was over a longer period of time and much more happened which I think it made it more interesting. This book "The Dinner" is told over one evening with back stories. It was good and had a few twists but I did not love it like I did the first book I read by this author. I will definitely read him again though.</text></scrape>
