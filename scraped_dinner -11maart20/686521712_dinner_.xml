Paul Lohman and his wife Claire are having dinner with Paul's brother Serge and his wife Babette. No one is looking forward to the dinner; the brothers don't seem to like each other much, and everyone appears to have other things on their minds. The story is told on several timelines: all the real-time action takes place during the dinner, but we get many flashbacks and musings from Paul throughout to reveal what's going on under the surface. And "under the surface" is really where the ideas of this book live. Themes of tolerance and what it means to really "belong," what rights we have in society and what price we pay (fair or not) for overstepping our bounds are at the core of the novel. I don't know that I can say I enjoyed it, exactly, but I definitely couldn't put it down.Recommended for: people who liked the movie The Grifters, fans of reading between the lines, the not-too-sensitive, cynics, sociopaths.Quote: "It was the combination of the lighting and the smell of Boursin that kept me from seeing my brother and sister-in-law's garden party as anything but an old, outdated TV commercial from twenty years ago or longer. As imitation cheese that had nothing whatsoever to do with French cheese, just like here, in the heart of the Dordogne, where everyone was only playing at being in France, while the French themselves were most conspicuous by their absence."</text></scrape>
