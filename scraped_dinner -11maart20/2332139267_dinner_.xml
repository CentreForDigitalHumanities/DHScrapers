I gave it five stars for excellent writing and cutting social commentary, and for the perfect execution of an unsettling kind of black comedy. This book left me queasy and dispirited, but reflective. Art doesn't always have to make you feel good, and this art certainly would leave few readers chipper and optimistic. But it did leave me marveling at Koch's imagination, skill, and inventiveness, and eager to explore his other writing.***SPOILERS***The novel is structured around the courses of a dinner at an unnamed fancy Dutch restaurant between Paul and Claire Lohman; Paul's brother, Serge Lohman (the famous politician and leading candidate to be the next Prime Minister); and Serge's wife, Babette. Herman Koch makes liberal use of flashbacks to let the reader step outside the bounds of this single time and place, and masterfully uses Paul (the narrator) to slowly unveil the background of this seemingly innocuous dinner between two couples who perhaps do not get along all that well.The pacing is superb. I was on the edge of my seat even as nothing in particular was happening because there is such a strong sense throughout the narrative of dark things that are being kept hidden and may be revealed later. In fact they are revealed later in thorough detail, but nothing can be quite as unnerving as waiting for all the information to come out. Paul frequently and explicitly omits details like names of people and places and personal information about them, saying that it is unimportant or not anybody's business. This obsession with privacy serves to keep the reader in the dark and made me wonder how many other details he was not sharing. At dinner the couples are sitting down together to discuss how to handle something awful that their children have done. That knowledge, which is only partial for much of the book, contrasts disturbingly with the light tone of their conversation as they order wine and appetizers.The reader is permitted to know how much Paul dislikes his brother, but is ignorant of how Serge actually feels about Paul, and as the plot develops the reader gets more and more of a sense that Paul is an unreliable narrator. That was one of the most unsettling parts of the experience for me. It is hard not to take the side of the narrator, especially when his situation seems sympathetic. But midway through the book I started to suspect everything was not as Paul was reporting it. Well, that's not quite right, but rather that all of the motivations that Paul attributes to others may be wildly off the mark. Paul reports several violent incidents he has engaged in which are never mentioned by others, and later reveals that he has a brain disorder, around which time I began to see that not everything he says has happened has, necessarily, happened. But then what is the reader to believe about his narrative? Many of the other details are supported by the characters' conversation over dinner, and their apparent truth is highly unsettling, too.Paul seems to value the happiness of his family above everything else, and this is taken to an extreme with regard to what he is willing to do to preserve their "happiness" when in fact there is no option available that would leave the family happy in the true sense of the word. Or perhaps I should say no option that would leave an ordinary family happy.</text></scrape>
