That is not to say it wasn't well-written or engaging, but the thing about this book that I couldn't stomach was that there are simply no redeeming qualities about any of the characters. By the time I'd made it to the section of the book titled "main course", the only reason I finished the book was simply because I wanted to be able to honestly mark this book as 'read'. I also disliked the narrator's story-telling style. He will veer away from the action of the scene or what's going on to quietly rant about the pretentiousness of the restaurant, the stuffiness of the staff, or his unbridled hate towards his brother. Then, he'll veer off into his own recollections of the past, all the while still inserting his snide and opinionated comments about different topics. Every time he criticized the empty space on his plate, I rolled my eyes. I get it Paul, it pisses you off that they're charging you for an empty plate! I was told to read this because I loved Gone Girl, and The Girl on the Train. I imagine many people who liked those books will also like this book, because of the amoral characters and slow reveal of the "event" that set the dinner in motion, but even the characters in those books had a few redeeming qualities, even if they were still horrid people. The people in this book are full-blown sociopaths, with no human qualities aside from looking human. </text></scrape>
