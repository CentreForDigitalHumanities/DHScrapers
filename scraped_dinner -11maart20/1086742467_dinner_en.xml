It made me think of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Of Oprah Winfrey.These lines from The Dinner perfectly encapsulate my feelings toward this unappetizing bestseller from the Netherlands. Herman Koch is a well-known writer of fiction in his native country, but this is his first work to have gone global. I feel as joyful about this as I do about the spread of Ebola. Too much attention is paid to these manipulative and misogynist potboilers, which are neither entertaining nor enlightening. I'm not a fan of Noir fiction, but I can be seduced if the characters are complex and the plot is suspenseful. I figured this thing out at midpoint, yet I had to remain at the table for an interminable meal which, by comparison, would have made a fundraising dinner for Hillary, 2016 seem provocative. Even a brief discussion about grappa failed to ignite my passion. Its structure is both an homage to the play The God of Carnage and an indigestible rant against the nouveau cuisine of the late twentieth century. In any case, I'd rather be forced to watch reruns of Oprah Winfrey's old TV show, then to read anything else by this Koch.
