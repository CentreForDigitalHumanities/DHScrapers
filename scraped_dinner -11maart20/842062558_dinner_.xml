I remember seeing the front cover for the first time at my local Walmart. It grabbed my eye and the synopsis was highly intriguing. It wasn't until I started reading it that I even realized it was not originally written in English. I REALLY hope that isn't why I got a little lost from time to time. The writing style threw me off a little as well. The author kept avoiding answering questions, as if he knew he wanted certain details in his story but couldn't explain why. SPOILER WARNING!!! - DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT - SPOILER WARNING!!!A few questions I still have after completing this book:1. What illness did Paul suffer from, that he needed pills for, that he was worried about Michel inheriting?2. What did Claire become sick with when she was in the hospital?3. What was the "parents decision" from the amniotic fluid report that Claire had hidden from Paul?Honestly, too many questions went unanswered. This had the potential to be a good story, but there were too many holes in the storyline for my taste.</text></scrape>
