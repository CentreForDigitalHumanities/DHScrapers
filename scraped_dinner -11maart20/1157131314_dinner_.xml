One of those novels that just splurges out events and at the final chapter everything's "don't worry we fixed it without a proper explanation". All I wanted to read about was the big bad incident that everyone's avoiding and it was told well going back and forth in time to learn more about the characters. But I feel like it was brushed over. It focused more on the aftermath than the actual incident itself. Obviously the book shows the way families will protect each other even if that means destroying extended family members. The end was pretty predictable once you knew the gist of what had happened. The father character is seriously messed up and I found the fascism to be more for shock value to than really add to the novel. Yes the violence helps you delve into his character but it was just so sloppy. I feel like things could've been wrapped up together better and entwined the actions of different characters neater.</text></scrape>
