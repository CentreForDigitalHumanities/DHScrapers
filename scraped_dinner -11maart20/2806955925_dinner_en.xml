When I was a child I was one of those annoying kids that didn’t like anything apart from what I liked, if this makes sense. I didn’t like this, I didn’t like that. I didn’t want this, I didn’t want that. As I grew up things did improve a little bit but I carried on doing what I knew best, being annoying about food (and other stuff as well). Now, as an adult (?) and because I know I’m still a bit (too) fussy, I don’t particularly like going out for a meal regardless of the kind of food or restaurant. Why do I have to give an explanation about not finishing a meal when I’m the one who’s paying for it?All this to say that this was one of the best meals I ever had the pleasure of having. A really pleasant surprise for a fussy bugger like me. Everything was simply delicious and cleverly presented. From the starters to the strong espresso at the very end, I devoured it all. Mr Koch is a really good chef and I certainly will be coming back for more. I heard that some people didn’t like this restaurant at all and complained about the food being too heavy and the staff very rude. Some people even say this is a restaurant for pretentious people. Don’t listen to them. Let them have their spare ribs with chips somewhere else or go to bloody McDonalds. Just book yourself a table and enjoy. 4.5 Michelin stars. </text></scrape>
