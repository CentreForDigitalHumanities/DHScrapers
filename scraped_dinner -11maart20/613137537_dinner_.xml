The main character and his wife are despicable. Paul, our main character and narrator, truly is psychotic. Although we never do find out what his disorder is, we can get many clues. He is violent and irrational to say the least. I found the whole premise of this book to be so unsetteling. I don't think I can recommend this to my friends, however, if you are in the mood for a dark tale, this may be your next read!</text></scrape>
