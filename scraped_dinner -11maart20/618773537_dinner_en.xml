I only finished this because it was chosen for our book club, and it was only chosen for our book club because it is called "the European Gone Girl." It is NOT Gone Girl, (which is an awesome book) and it is not a dark, complex novel about "how far people will go for their children." Really??? Is there any kind of foothold in reality when parents will completely dismiss the inhumanity of their children killing a homeless person? What connection are we suppose to be able to make to our own lives when the main protagonist can indiscriminately threatens or beats up anyone in the story who ever annoys him? It is like trying to find something deep and profound in the actions of Mike Tyson!I think the author thinks he's writing a 21st century version of Crime and Punishment. Nope, he's just written a really really banal piece of fiction. It infuriates me that the critics are all hyped up about this book. It is an unreliable first person narrator -- big deal!! That is not a new literary device -- read The Great Gatsby and you'll see how it's done. </text></scrape>
