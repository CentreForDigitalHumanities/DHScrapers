Immediately. So that you can start dissecting the problem and arguing about what you would do in the same circumstances.The book is divided into courses and from the beginning, Koch gives the reader tantalising little morsels of the trouble that lies ahead - “What would this evening have been like if, no more than an hour ago, I had simply waited downstairs until it was time to go, rather than climb the stairs to Michel’s room? What would the rest of our lives been like?”Pardon the pun, but I’m still digesting this story (and it’s days since I finished reading it) – it’s a quick, gripping, disturbing and brilliant read.Read my full review here: http://booksaremyfavouriteandbest.wor...</text></scrape>
