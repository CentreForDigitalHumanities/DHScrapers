The problem is that out of seven main characters, five were completely insensitive / cruel and the reader does not get inside the heads of the other two. Therefore you are not really rooting for anyone. Plus I guessed one of the big surprises before it happened. It's a disturbing read, but I found the reactions of the parents to the crisis too far-fetched to be believable.The story revolves around two brothers and their wives having dinner at an upscale restaurant; well-known and well-liked politician Serge wants to discuss how to deal with the terrible actions of their teenage sons, while narrator Paul and his wife try to avoid the topic. Interspersed between the courses of their interminable meal, Paul reflects back on episodes in his own life and his son Michel's life. Koch is to be commended for making the narrator's true personality emerge slowly, which lends extra creepiness to his recounting of events.</text></scrape>
