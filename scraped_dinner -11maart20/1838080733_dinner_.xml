I was glad I listened to this as an audiobook instead of reading it. At least as an audiobook I could put it on 2x speed. While this is an okay premise, and would have potentially made a great short story, it's FAR too long. The narrator is going through a very worrisome situation, but he's terribly involved with the minutia of everything about the dinner/restaurant to the point that it takes away from the meat of the story. The actual story and characters seemed very shallow... They had backgrounds, but it was extremely stereotypical. Even the attempted approach at addressing mental illness was poorly navigated.</text></scrape>
