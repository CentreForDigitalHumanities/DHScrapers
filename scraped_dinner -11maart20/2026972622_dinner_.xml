I knew from the beginning that I would not like it but I cannot not finish a book. The narration was ridiculous -"I'm not going to say what was wrong with Claire, not here", "so without going into detail about Claire's illness...", it took entirely too long to get to the plot, and the long drawn out descriptions of mundane things like men peeing in the bathroom and descriptions of their food, and the constant mention of the restaurant's manager's pinky all got on my nerves. Really, I cannot understand how this became a movie. Just an awful awful story!edit: reading reviews now and seeing lots of comparisons to Gone Girl, now THAT book I could not finish so it's no wonder I didn't like this book as well yet I finished it :/</text></scrape>
