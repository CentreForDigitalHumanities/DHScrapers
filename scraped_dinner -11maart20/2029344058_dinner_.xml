But I knew from the blurb that something was coming, and I'm glad I stuck with it. When the reveal comes, and you realize what these people are really there in that restaurant for, and who they really are, it's quite the punch.There is a lot going on in this book; general commentary about people's capacity for violence, the things parents do for their kids, adoption, political satire, mocking of pretentious and expensive restaurants that serve nearly-empty plates, even a sidenote on how rich Dutch people buy all the real-estate in certain holiday areas in France and crowd out young locals. I enjoyed the real meat of the plot, the study of these characters, the incident that leads them to be in that dinner and what they're going to do about it, but I thought there was too much of everything else (especially for such a short book) and not everything works.However, I still liked the book. If you have a book club, it's an excellent pick because possibly the most fun part of reading it would be discussing it afterwards. (For those who aren't part of one, the BBC World Book Club had a great episode about it, where readers discussed the book directly with the author)(view spoiler)[My favourite thing about the book was the gradual revelations about Claire. I believe she was a psychopath and she is a much creepier character than Paul and possibly even scarier than Michel. Paul's "syndrome" or "illness" was made up by the author, I don't think it matches a real-life thing. In my opinion it was a bit contrived, but then I read another reader's theory here on goodreads that Paul could actually be a fantasist, that he does get violent thoughts but imagines that he really beat up the principal and this brother when it's really all in his head. By that theory, Claire would be the only one of the adults who committed an act of violence. I REALLY like this theory, especially because it was a bit too much imo for Paul to have hit his brother full in the face with a burning hot pan (imagine the horrible burns) and then keep beating him, and they still meet normally afterwards as a family. It didn't sound realistic to me. Listening to the author on the BBC World Book Club, however, to him it all really happened. I think I would rather stick to that reader's interpretation though lol. It made the book more interesting to me. (hide spoiler)]</text></scrape>
