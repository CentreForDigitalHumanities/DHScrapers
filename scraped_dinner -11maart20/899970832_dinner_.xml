The reader is challenged on his/her values. Read on...The narrator, Paul, takes us through a simple past of a dinner at an upscale restaurant shared by his brother and both wives.Koch structures this novel's sections with menu courses from 'Aperitif' to 'Digestif' and everything in between. Throughout the evening, Paul, our narrator parallels backstories from the lives of these players, which moves the plot to their present situation, and to the real reason for the dinner.All is not what it appears. Reminiscent of Robert Browning's famed 'dramatic monologues' (for you poetry lovers), this protagonist gradually changes with each anecdote revealing a nature that is far different than one expects: he grows morally reprehensible!But the classic question for the reader is more than uncomfortable. It becomes - What would YOU do??? Koch is successful at having the reader either face his/her truth or retreat into denial. Either way, you will lose some sleep thinking about this book, these characters, and their choices.Nice library book club selection to end the season. Can't wait for our discussion this week!</text></scrape>
