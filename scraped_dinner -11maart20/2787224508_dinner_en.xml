The pacing, the construction, and the dark humor unveils some very strange family dynamics. Over the course of the dinner we get an inkling as to what ‘normal’ means to one brother and which one wants to do the right thing. Never has so much been said with a raised eyebrow and the look between spouses!If you get nothing out of this book other than a kick out of the sly transformation of the characters’ personalities, then it’s worth it. I thought it was a terrifically crafted piece. </text></scrape>
