Like many, I read this book because it is heralded as this summer's Gone Girl. I guess because it allegedly has a plot twist akin to Gone Girl's? Well, it does not. I am not sure it has a plot twist at all. More like a slow, revolving, plot turn. I didn't really care for it. I thought Claire was too 2 dimensional to be convincing.</text></scrape>
