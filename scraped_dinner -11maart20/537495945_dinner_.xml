However, the book utterly fails in its comparisons to GONE GIRL -- it's missing the satisfaction that comes with a good twist, the horror of choices careening out of control, the sheer pleasure, as a reader, of following a nasty character through a story. Books with unreliable narrators and those nasty characters done right are like roller coasters: the whole time you can't wait to be done, and yet you thoroughly enjoy the thrill. This is not that kind of ride; it's the kind you want to get off pretty soon after it starts, but you can't.</text></scrape>
