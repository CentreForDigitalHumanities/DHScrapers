I'm still not quite sure and since it's been well over a month since I read it I just had to get some words down before it was totally gone from my mind. Although, this isn't the kind of book that I'm likely to forget right away. And that's one of the pros. This book is a button pusher - - the scenario is extreme, the characters unlikeable, the atmosphere uncomfortable.While I usually like to read books that I find enjoyable (just look at my goodreads list - lots of books taking place in the British countryside!), this one got my attention and held it. It made me think about how far parents will go to protect their children, even when their child is clearly wrong. It was disturbing and unsettling and while that wouldn't be the kind of book I'd want to read all the time, I do think there is something to be said for the uncomfortable read.However, I was disappointed with a few of the aspects of this book that lessened its impact for me. The introduction of a hereditary factor that accounts for someone's violence isn't totally new but I felt like that undermined the situation rather than enhanced it. And the violence of the narrator in his backstory was so over the top it was ridiculous to think that he was having these episodes without any ramifications whatsoever. A few other details just didn't ring true under scrutiny and so although I was engaged in the book it does not hold up for me when I think back on. An interesting idea but a flawed execution.(For a similar but better take on this subject try Defending Jacob by William Landay)</text></scrape>
