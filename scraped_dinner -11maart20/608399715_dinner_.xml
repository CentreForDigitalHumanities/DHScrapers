A lot of that is due to Weirdo, so I guess I should thank him. A few I've found on my own and this is one of them.So many people have judged this book based on the actions taken by the parents. I don't think that constitutes whether the book is good. I was intrigued from the first couple pages and I continued reading that way through the whole thing. I felt completely drawn into this world, and the father's mind, what he shared of it. There were times when I was veering madly back and forth between feeling like I couldn't believe he was handling the situation that way to feeling like I could absolutely believe it, or at least believe the thoughts behind it in the darker corners of my brain. The one thing that drove me nuts was the never revealed "condition" of the father. Can anyone clue me in?</text></scrape>
