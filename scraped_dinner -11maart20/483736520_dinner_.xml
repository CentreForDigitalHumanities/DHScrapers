The horrible story of this novel unravels over the course of a beautifully presented dinner.The scenery starts shaking and crumbling down as the dinner moves from appetizers to main course, reaching its climax by dessert.This book manages to be violent, gross, witty and artistic, all at the same time.This book is a paradox to the society, dominated by appearances, and the point that the author is making (at least for me) loud and clear, is for the people to break free from the shackles that hold appearances together.For me this was gross, yet witty and thought provoking piece of writing that will stay with me for a while.</text></scrape>
