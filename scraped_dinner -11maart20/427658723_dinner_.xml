There is Paul, the narrator, and Serge, who he seems to rather dislike.By the end so much has been revealed about these two men and the reasons behind this dinner that it's hard to imagine you ever knew so little.Koch's slow reveals, the way he cuts off chapters in the middle of the action and leaves you constantly shifting from past to present is wonderfully disorienting and yet spellbinding. A really impressive feat of a book. Dark, dark, dark but deliciously so.</text></scrape>
