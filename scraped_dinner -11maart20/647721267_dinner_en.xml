I was mostly uncomfortable all the way through. I was frightened at the fact that much of what occurred could really be true, that whole families can be twisted and troubled instead of just the one obviously disturbed person you would automatically blame for visible actions. I hated that the entire time, the main character was hiding things; keeping secrets and lies from the world as well as the reader, either to dole out strategically later, or to keep to himself forever. It was disconcerting, but also what kept me reading, waiting for some answer that never really came. The Dinner did make me think about my own family, our values, what messages I send unintentionally, what secrets are worth keeping and how much honesty is the right amount to share with the world, so for that, I am giving it 3 stars.</text></scrape>
