Dirty, dark, despicable people; I thought it would be the type of terrible that would be enjoyable as fiction.I was wrong. I did not enjoy this book.The plot unfolds during dinner. Neither couple wants to attend this dinner, held at a fine dining restaurant, but they need to discuss their children, who have done something terrible. I hated the plotline, and not just because it was boring, but because it was trite. It didn’t feel realistic. It felt far too over-the-top to be believable, as though Koch was trying to find the most shockworthy issue for these parents to discuss during dinner, and then shock you more when you learn how the two couples decide to resolve the problem. It’s also the longest dinner ever. I swear, every time one of them got up from the table, they’d be gone for the next 20-30 minutes. The main course arrived, and I swear no one ate it for the next hour.I hated every character, and not because they were terrible people (they are, every last one of them). The MC was especially irritating, because you’re in his head the entire book, and he spends half of it ranting about people, things, and situations that he doesn’t like. It’s tiresome. His jealousy issues become overbearing. He’s just this grumpy, violent asshole and I didn’t want to listen to him anymore, especially because he gets extremely repetitive at times (like when describing the waitresses at the restaurant - I get it: they’re wearing black pinafores. I get it, she’s “your wife.”)What’s with the constant “my wife” thing, anyway? Verbal tic? Bad editing? Bad translation? No clue, but it annoyed me to no end. Speaking of annoyances - one of the teenage boys (16 to 17), this hardened boy, calls him mother “mama?” I’m not buying it, and every mention of “mama” grated on my last nerve. It would be fine for a kid under ten, but this was an older boy. It just sounded weird.I actually think the translation is just bad. So many semi-colons and colons in this book. So many strange word usages. For instance, the MC at one point is discussing an event that occurred while he was still teaching. He says, “when I was still standing before a class.” That’s just awkward. Why not say “when I was still teaching,” or something? So, yea, I think translation might have something to do with the annoyances.And lets not overlook that Koch just made up a vague mental illness, I guess to add drama and depth to his main narrator? I don’t know. For me it felt, well, made up. Supposedly it’s modeled after autism or Asperger’s, but with some added details to make the main character even less likable. Koch apparently has said after the fact that he didn’t want people trying to tie the MC’s “condition” to a real psychological/developmental disorder. I say he’s just lazy and this alleged condition was just way too convenient.In any event, the MC’s story meanders to and fro and there were times when he was incredibly hard to follow. I would have to backtrack a few pages to try and figure out where in the timeline a certain event took place, because he wasn’t ever very clear. I wouldn’t call him unreliable so much as unclear.A big disappointment for me. Trying so hard to be dark, I just found it forced.</text></scrape>
