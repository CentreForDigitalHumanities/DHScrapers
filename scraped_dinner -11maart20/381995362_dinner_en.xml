That would distract you from the point. The point is I read this book and I enjoyed it. Isn't that more important? Enjoying something? Anything? I don't mean the empty enjoyment empty-headed morons talk about when they say they enjoyed the afternoon. They can't even remember half of what they did and only say they enjoyed it because they have no better sense. No I mean I read it in less than 24 hours because I couldn't put it down. That it proved thoughts and stirred emotions and desires to find out what happened next. </text></scrape>
