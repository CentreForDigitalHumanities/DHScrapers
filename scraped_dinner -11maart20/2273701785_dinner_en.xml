Moncrieff</author><rating>really liked it</rating><text>4.5 starsThis is the best book I've read in a long time--I'm not sure what genre it's been classified as, but whether it's called this or not, it's definitely a horror story.Unlike many readers, I don't require the characters in the books I read to be "likeable"...all I ask is that they be interesting. And the characters in this book certainly were. The book's main scenario starts off seeming like a fairly innocuous dinner at a fancy restaurant between two brothers and their spouses. Early on, you learn the couples are there to discuss the repercussions of the very bad thing their children have done. And their children are, indeed, horrific, but it's not the actions of the kids that are the most chilling.Lots of reviewers have talked about how horrible Paul, the protagonist, is and how much they hated him, but when the book begins, Paul is an everyman most people will be able to relate to. There is some hint of marital strife, though he still loves his wife. There's sibling rivalry and the frustration/exhaustion of having to put up with his brother's airs. All Paul wants to do is stay home with his wife and son and not have to endure the dog-and-pony show at the high-end restaurant that serves a few lettuce leaves and calls it salad. Who couldn't relate to that? Who hasn't felt that frustration, or that desire to just cancel the fancy dinner and stay home? And it is that relatability that makes Koch's story so powerful. When we identify with a character, what happens when we're suddenly faced with aspects of his personality we may find abhorrent?This novel kept me guessing the whole way through, but it didn't have the contrived "Gotcha!" twist of so many psychological thrillers. Koch's genius is letting his story slowly, gradually get darker and darker, and before you know it, you're trapped in a thoroughly disturbing scenario you didn't see coming. Well done.</text></scrape>
