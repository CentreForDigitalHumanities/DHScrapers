What if you and your spouse weren’t both aware of the full extent of his misdoings? What if there were another child involved, the child of your own brother? What if your brother also happened to be your nemesis, and one night, you, him, and your respective spouses sit down to dinner in a public place and begin to hash out the repercussions and how to deal with them? What if? Join us for Herman Koch’s The Dinner.Paul Lohman is a complicated man. He’s anxious, untrusting, and bitter about living in the shadow of his big-shot politician brother, Serge. Luckily, he has the love of a strong woman, Claire, to help keep him balanced. Still, tension seeps from his pores on a regular basis – and when his teen son Michel partakes in a brutal act of violence, Paul’s anxiety skyrockets. Michel wasn’t alone, though; he was joined in the act by Serge and Babette’s son Rick. And now, the two couples come together at dinner at a pretentious restaurant in Amsterdam under the guise of simply catching up, though all members of this party of four know what they’re really there to address.Herman Koch lays down each twist and turn and revelation over a five-course dinner. Through each moment of awkwardness or tension, suspense or horror among these four, there are also other factors to consider: the watchful eyes of the other diners, many of whom are aware of the political celebrity in their company; the snooty waiter whose laughably elaborate descriptions of each dish in each course become more irritating as the evening progresses; the slowly surfacing truth about Claire and her son. Paul flashes back over the course of dinner, and through this device the reader is brought up to speed on the full extent of the horror of Michel and Rick's senseless act. Were they just boys being boys? Or is there something more sinister at play here? And now comes the biggest question of all: How should the parents of these teenagers handle the situation? Do they turn their children in? Or try to bury the entire thing? And will they ever agree on what to do next? This all adds up to a torturous dining experience – and a thrilling read.Herman Koch’s The Dinner is about relationships and family, the human psyche and sibling rivalry. Ultimately, though, Koch’s novel is about the lengths to which one will go in order to protect their loved ones – and how those measures taken are often near impossible to swallow.Head to www.EverydayeBook.com for more eBook reviews </text></scrape>
