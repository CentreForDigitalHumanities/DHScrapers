Ok, don't tell, but don't say I'm not going to tell, just go on about your story, just leave it out. But instead it is like, "I know something you don't know." Yes, Dear Paul, Dear old Dad, did this repeatedly, I'm not going to tell you were I taught, or what my illness is, or what my wife had, or what hospital she was in, etc, etc. Drove me freaking crazy. I did not like this storyline, not a single character. I cannot believe this was compared to Gone Girl, that is one major stretch, I just don't see it.</text></scrape>
