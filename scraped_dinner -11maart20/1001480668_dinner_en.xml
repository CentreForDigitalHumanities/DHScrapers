A lot of reviewers pointed out that the main reason for their negative review was this, the lack of proper relatable characters, and some redeemable quality in them. That did not bothered me at all, that’s exactly why I loved this so much.All in all, I was spellbound by this book and literally devoured it in only 2 days. I highly recommend it, especially if you like disturbed characters, ones that although are not very likable make for a great read. There were a few plot aspects that I did not understand at all: Paul’s psychological disorder and its suppose genetic transmission, Claire’s mysterious decease and hospitalization and especially the "Decision By Parents" question at the very end. I have read a few discussion here on Goodreads about it and the general consensus appears to be that Michel was tested for Paul's disorder, it came back positive, and Claire decided to go ahead with the pregnancy, and not tell him. Now, if that relates to a second pregnancy sill remains a question for me, or maybe a paternity test. The very last line of the book ‘dear old dad’ kind of appoints to that theory. So many questions and so few answers.Any clues or theories about that would be highly appreciated. </text></scrape>
