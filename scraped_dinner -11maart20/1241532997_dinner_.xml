I will say I did hate them, all of them, and that I thought there were parts that could have been better that had nothing to do with that. Certain things were left out (Claire's illness, what he was exactly medicated for) that felt really contrived in a trying to leave something to the imagination way. I thought that rang really hollow. The question of how far would you go for your kid, and the device of the dinner and narrator perspective were interesting though. I don't really recommend it because I don't think it's a strong enough book to be worth being so uncomfortable while reading it.</text></scrape>
