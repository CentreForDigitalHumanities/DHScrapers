What an anticlimactic let-down. The writing was self-indulgent in the vein of "look how clever I am" and the observations on middleclass cruelty and despair were stale, formulaic and caricatural. What I am saying is that this has already been done and done better, and while I don't have a problem with oversaturation, I do have a problem when this novel is made out to be some kind of brilliant grotesque spectacle. For one thing, it cops out early in the story and doesn't have the stomach to push its premise in more critical and uncomfortable directions. For another, it becomes increasingly dull when you realize "huh...that's really all there is to it." It starts out relatively interesting and bold and then simply falls flat. I could have excused its decrease in quality if it weren't blatant antibourgeois fap. Don't be fooled; antibourgeois fap is supposed to make the bourgeois feel better, as in: "I am definitely better than these people but do acknowledge the very dark and problematic aspects of our social status."It's a fun plane book, but otherwise tame and empty.</text></scrape>
