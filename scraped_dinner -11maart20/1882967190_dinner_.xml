I thought the setting of the novel, a table at a fancy restaurant, was unique and intriguing. However, the lack of character development and irrelevant chatter did not make for an interesting read. After I learned the purpose of the couples meeting at the restaurant, I wanted to put the book down because I did not think it would get better. And it didn't, but I finished it just to see what happened. Overall, this is a book you finish and say "meh" to; there isn't anything particularly thought-provoking in it.</text></scrape>
