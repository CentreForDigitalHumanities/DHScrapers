Fine dining and no expense spared vs. violence and crime is an interesting contrast, and the cleverly constructed detail of the staff and food contrasted nicely with the loose details and hints that were thrown (like crumbs!) to the reader along the way. It kept me turning the pages but wow, these were some seriously unlikeable characters. It's a little twisty, but not as much as I had hoped, and I saw the ending coming a mile off. Never the less, it's an interesting and dark look at family relationships and secrets, and ultimately what we do to protect those that we love. </text></scrape>
