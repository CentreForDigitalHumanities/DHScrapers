As I started to read this book, I've had an increasingly uneasy feeling all over me. It isn't just that I hated all the characters. It's the way the whole 'incident' is treated by them. As if it's nothing important. Nothing much. The way violence is described as it's something normal and good. I don't know. I finished the book and I felt a sense of relief. Someone wrote in their review that this is - in some way - a 'fascist' book. And I can't but agree with them.</text></scrape>
