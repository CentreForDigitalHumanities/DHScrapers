It was missing some key element that makes works interesting. I honestly can't even put my finger on what it is. I do know that the character and (nonexistent) character development was a big letdown. People compare this to Gone Girl and I have no idea why. A book filled with sociopaths does not a Gone Girl clone make.I have no problem with books filled with utterly despicable characters. Take You for instance: there isn't a single redeemable character in that whole thing and I adored it. In fact, I really love books with love-to-hate-them, totally-can't-sympathize-with-them characters. And while The Dinner is full of assholes, they're just... annoying. I didn't like them, I didn't even hate them. The only emotion I felt was annoyance. The whole book feels like an attempt to be edgy or make a point, when really there is NO message here. How far would you go to protect your child? Are you kidding me? There's no commentary on that issue here, because the actions are rendered null and void by the fact that everyone's a freaking psychopath. Show me REALISTIC parents going to extremes for their kid. That would be interesting.I also felt like The Dinner was trying so hard to convey messages about society, but it was all blurred. Like racism: the main character (and his wife, really) are hugely racist. And I mean the author probably isn't at all, but their actions were written in a way where it wasn't clear where their perspective and the message of the book diverged. And all the adoption stuff? I don't understand where either of those fit in. I think the author was trying to be clever and edgy and provocative (since the reader is obviously supposed to be distressed at these characters' beliefs) but shock factor only gets so far when you have no clear underlying sense of right and wrong. I mean, maybe that in itself is interesting to some people, but I found it very offputting. I do have a lot of issues with this (...obviously!) but it's really the bland writing that makes this book so blase. It's just flat. Though being a translated work, it's hard to pin that directly on the author. In any case, I know that in a month or so this will be one of those books I've forgotten I've read. And when I remember it, my reaction will be "ugh, that book. Why did I read it?" </text></scrape>
