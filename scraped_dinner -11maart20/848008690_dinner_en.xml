I think I had too high of an expectation for a "shock factor" that I never received. That quote from the narrator talking about his sister-in-law...."that it would have been a waste of all that time she'd invested to stop now-the way you don't put aside a bad book when you're halfway through it. You finish it reluctantly.....Perhaps the ending would make up for some of it." That's how I felt so I kept reading with anticipation. The ending never made up for anything. The feeling from the beginning is one of dread. The author definitely does an excellent job making you feel dreadful and the unreliable narrator adds to that heaviness. I don't know what I expected but I don't feel satisfied with this read. I can definitely see how the reviews are all over the place for this book. I think however this could be a great discussion for a reading group but I don't think it's an enjoyable read.</text></scrape>
