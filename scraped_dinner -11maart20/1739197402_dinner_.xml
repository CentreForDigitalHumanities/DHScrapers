It's got some genuinely shocking twists, but even those shocks feel like they've been inserted to fit a structural need, as if Koch could tell that the audience was starting to slip away. (To be honest, I was.) It's a problem possibly attributable to Koch's choice of shock--focusing on a lead character who is gradually revealed to have a severe form of mental instability--as the book feels like you're being rambled at by a dopey psychotic even before it's explained that yes, you actually are being rambled at by a dopey psychotic on an erection-imposed meds vacation. The brief moments of black humor that humanize the characters never lasts that long, and the actual innocents on display are portrayed as being so weak and ineffectual that it's impossible to imagine a circumstance where the regular world's day-to-day difficulties wasn't going to destroy them anyway. In the end, it's a book that never really says anything (beyond generalities like "do brutes deserve love, aren't mothers are committed, which one of us is REALLY crazy"), choosing instead to lay all of its bets on the form it chooses to ramble them in. It passes the time, sure, but it's not like time needs the help.</text></scrape>
