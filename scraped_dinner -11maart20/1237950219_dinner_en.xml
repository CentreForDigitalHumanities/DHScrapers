Paul is an ordinary man that does not call his wife by her name, rather he says "My Wife." Unknown to her, he feels that she is smarter and wiser than him, thus his insecurities shine through in more ways than one. Claire her name is foreign to him, the only thing that he feels attached to her is their son Michel. Michel lives in a solitary life that refuses to open up about anything that is going on, hence his father regularly snoops and invades his privacy, Although he should trust his son, Claire and him thinks that there is something serious going on.Serge the brother of Paul is a politician who lives a luxurious life Famous among his peers, he often is asked to get autographs. While his wife is not as reputable, she is likeable in the eyes of her brother in law. Described as beautiful, Paul does not see why she is not treated with the same adoration as she rightfully should. Common to his brother, he has a son that shares a relationship with Michel. Platonic and awkwardly uncomfortable, the two of them share things in secret.The two couples talk about minor things attempting to avoid the bigger picture. There is a big elephant in the room that they are trying to ignore, soon it becomes too large to avoid, leading them to confront the serious matter at hand. Filled with humor, drama and great characterization, The Dinner is a mesmerizing novel about filling the void when trying not to create tension.I absolutely love how this novel was written! Unlike other novels,it was divided in sections with Dinner terms like "Appetizer,Desert", and so forth. Those terms like that really captured the beauty of the novel, it was not typical like "Chapters or Parts."Outstanding novel, looking forward to reading more books by Koch.</text></scrape>
