From these brief, not too detailed reviews and from the dust jacket and the blurbs on the back of the book, I had expected The Dinner to be not terribly unlike Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf?: a conversational novel that grows ever more bitter and ever darker as the novel progresses.Now, the conversation during the titular dinner does become rather bitter and rather dark, but it is the events that unfold, rather than the conversation, that are truly astonishing and thought-provoking.But to arrive at the final pay-off, we readers must be patient. This novel is 292 pages, and the first 2/3 (roughly, the first 200 pages) is background for the climax. Reading through these first 200 pages, our interest as readers is certainly held, but we wonder if the novel is going to actually deliver the emotional wallop that the reviews have promised. Well, be patient, fellow readers, and you will be rewarded.***********SPOILER ALERT****************************************************The Dinner poses two important questions: (1) Do you have an ethical duty to report a loved one or family member who has committed a serious crime? (2) How far would you go to protect that loved one from suffering the consequences of her/his crime?The Dinner is narrated by Paul. He tells the story of his son, Michel, and of his nephew, Rick. Rick is the son of Paul's brother, Serge, who is a very successful politician on the verge of being elected Prime Minister of The Netherlands.Michel and Rick are 15-years-old. One night, a bit drunk, they go to an ATM to withdraw cash to buy some final drinks. Inside the ATM is a homeless woman. They begin to bully her and accidentally end up killing her. This incident is witnessed by Rick's adopted brother, Beau, who is from Burkina Faso (a small African country) and is just a bit older than Rick and Michel.There is some very poor security camera video that is released to the public. Paul and Serge and and Paul's wife, Claire, recognize their sons in the video, though no one else does.Serge believes that they should turn the boys over to the authorities, and that's why he invites Paul and Claire to dinner: to try to convince them that it would be for the best to turn the boys in.Serge's own wife, Babette, disagrees with Serge, as do Paul and Claire; these three all want to let sleeping dogs lie.(Side note: as the novel has progressed and Paul has provided the background information about his own and his family's lives, we have come to see that Paul is very violent, prone to physical violence and someone who exhibits sociopathic personality traits--an inability to empathize with others. At one point, Paul had even violently attacked Serge with a frying pan, slamming it into Serge's face.)At the dinner, Serge is unable to convince Paul and Claire to see things his way. Babette argues against Serge as well, but he remains intent on revealing the boys' crime. Serge and Babette, at the end of the dinner, leave with Serge planning to follow through with his plan.Once Serge and Babette have left, Claire and Paul discuss their options. They decide that something must be done immediately to stop Serge from moving forward. Serge must be attacked--violently. Because of Paul's history of violence, they come to believe that the attack, in this case, should come from Claire, as they believe that an attack by Paul would be expected by Serge and would not change his mind, so Claire follows after Serge and Babette: she smashes Serge in the face with a wine glass, cutting his face horrifically and requiring he be taken to the hospital via ambulance.In the meantime, on the very same night, Michel and Rick carry out another murder, one that Claire herself had encouraged. Beau had been threatening Rick and Michel, demanding money to keep silent about what he had witnessed. Claire had previously told Michel to do whatever was necessary to keep Beau silent, and she implied that murder might be necessary. And that is precisely what Michel and Rick do.As the novel concludes, Claire's attack on Serge has proved successful, as he decides not to report the boys, and he even refuses to press charges against Claire. Beau is also dead, though Serge and Babette are ignorant of this fact: they simply think he is missing, and the media speculate that the adopted boy has run away back home to Burkina Faso.Michel and Rick get away with manslaughter via a murder, which they also gets away with.As we progress through this novel, we are at first sympathetic with Paul, but once we know him better, we see that he is a violent sociopath and that these traits have been passed down to his son. On the one hand, we are aghast at the brutality of Michel and Rick and want them to be punished. On the other hand, we see them as typical teenage boys acting rashly and violently as teenage boys are wont to do, so we don't want to see their whole lives destroyed because of this event. And we certainly think Serge is crazy for wanting to turn the boys in. But we also see that Michel is a sociopath with violent tendencies, and this violence is further born out when he and Rick murder Beau. We know that Michel should not be free, yet in some dark recess of our mind, we are thrilled that he has gotten away with murder. We know that Serge is right in wanting to expose the boys, yet we hate him for being right, and we hate his righteousness. Is blood thicker than ethical water? Do our duties to our families override our duties to society? How far should or can we go to protect our loved ones from the law?These questions are raised in The Dinner, but they are certainly not answered. The Dinner simply lays out the story and leaves we readers to debate the issues. The Dinner really drives home the import of these questions by allowing all the evil deeds to go unpunished. And further clouding the issues is our dislike of the one character, Serge, who really tries to do the right thing. These issues are what make this such a brilliant, engrossing novel.I loved it! </text></scrape>
