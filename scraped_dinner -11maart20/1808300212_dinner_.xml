Also, for an author to allow the main character to lay out every disgusting quality he possesses without hesitation or apology, in great detail, but spend, literally, paragraphs telling the reader "I'm not going to mention the name of..." as thought the name of the restaurant, or hospital, or medical complication, or other inconsequential detail was some big secret...? Utterly confusing. Why clam up about this? Why bring it up at all? I could go on but have wasted enough time on this book already. </text></scrape>
