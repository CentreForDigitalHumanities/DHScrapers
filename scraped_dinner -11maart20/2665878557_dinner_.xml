The little stories all left short. It was discipline to finish this book. They offered this in my Bookclub stating it was as controversial as “Let’s talk about Kevin”, but I found it hard to relate...not believable at all. I even looked at the movie trailer, which I thought they might be a more interesting, but they don’t only have terrible reviews too, but it IS very related to the book, even if they say the movie was terrible but the book wasn’t...would comment on the book but would never recommend it.</text></scrape>
