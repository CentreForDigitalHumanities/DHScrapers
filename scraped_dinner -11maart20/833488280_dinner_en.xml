What a riveting story. What would you do if your 15-year-old son and his cousin (your nephew) committed a crime that resulted in a death? They were caught on camera but the images are fuzzy and no one recognizes them but their parents. Would you turn them in, cover it up, ignore it, keep details secret from your spouse? Would you discuss the dilemma at a posh restaurant over a 5-course gourmet dinner? What if one of you is running for a high political office? If you liked Defending Jacob, you will like this one too. It was very well written, even if some things didn't seem plausible in real life.(less) </text></scrape>
