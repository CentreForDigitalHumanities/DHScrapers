A very intriguing & entertaining read, one in which I was never 100% sure as to what the characters would do & was totally engrossed by it. While at times the story was disturbing & uncomfortable it was still quite funny in parts - well it appealed to my sense of humour! The story is based round two couples dining at a local restaurant. The tale is broken up into chapters headed Aperitif, Appetiser etc - an idea I particularly liked - & the setting is wonderfully brought to life with the obsequious head waiter & Paul's irritation at his brothers table manners. As the meal progresses the friction between the couples increases & as the tension builds we learn what their boys have done & what they, as parents, intend to do about it. Are the characters believeable? Well in all honesty probably not - I can't imagine parents behaving this way.Likeable? Again no but I didn't want to empathise with their situation or feel compassion for them - if I had the whole tone of the book would have changed.It does makes you wonder what you'd do in the same situation although in this case things are not quite how they first appear....but is that just an excuse? I won' t say more as I don't want to spoil anything for future readers but its a book that begs to be discussed :o) I don't think its a tale I'll forget in a hurry.</text></scrape>
