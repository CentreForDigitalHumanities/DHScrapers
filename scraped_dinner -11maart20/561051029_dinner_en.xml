I work at the library, so there's usually plenty of other reading material for lunch. But this thriller was so compulsively readable I took it with me to read on the bus, while getting my coffee, and during my lunch. Reminiscent of Patricia Highsmith's Ripley novels, this mystery was made to be enjoyed in one or two sittings. It kind of gave me a queasy feeling of something bad happening, but I also felt a great desire to just find out what happens next already. The setup is that two brothers and their wives have gotten together at a fancy restaurant in Amsterdam to talk about a problem with their teenage sons, some trouble that the sons are in. The book is well under way before you find out exactly what the trouble is. The core reason many people will hate this book is that all the characters are basically horrible people. Some people don't enjoy that? People I know who hated Gone Girl always explain it by saying they despised both the husband and the wife. Anyway, it's not that I like the characters in Gone Girl or this novel- the appeal is more like a combination of plot where I don't know what will happen and the psychopathic darkness of being in someone's twisted mind combine to give it a compulsive quality. </text></scrape>
