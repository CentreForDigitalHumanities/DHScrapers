Talk about psychotic characters! THE DINNER, by Herman Koch, is a story that grows more shocking and more disturbing the more you analyze it. Koch (will someone PLEASE tell me how he pronounces his last name?!) weaves in details and backstories about his four main characters in the most distinct yet subtle way. I rank his story/character skills right up there with Patricia Highsmith and Kazou Ishiguro, two of my all-time favorites. Koch has a keen, cutting view of humanity; it is in turn, both honest and chilling.The Dinner is the story of two brothers and their wives who go out for dinner to discuss a situation their sons are involved in. (That's like calling a tiger a kitten. It's a pretty serious "situation.") The adults' solutions are as diverse as North, South, East, and West. And at least two of the four suggestions will rip the tablecloth out from under your dinner plate. Koch adds another layer, though: the structure. The novel takes place over dinner, one single, elegant mealâ€”plus quite a bit of backstory parsed out as slowly as the pompous waiter serves the meal. It starts with the Aperitif and continues through the Digestif. With each course, we learn a tiny bit more about each character, until it feels like Koch dumps a pot of stew on the table that splashes on the two couples and you, the reader. If you like shocking, disturbing, perfect stories, you will love this book.Five (Michelin) Stars</text></scrape>
