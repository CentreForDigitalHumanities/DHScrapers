That's not to say that the writing wasn't good, because I thought it was concise and had a lot of forward motion. When I began the book I had one perspective about the characters, but by the time it was through, I had completely changed my mind, just as (I suspect) the author intended. Paul and his wife Claire meet for a fancy dinner with Paul's brother, Serge and his wife. Serge is a candidate for prime minister, so he has made the reservations at a popular restaurant without having to wait the usual 3 months for a table. This puts Paul's back up right from the beginning, and things go downhill from there. As we discover, the dinner is to discuss a situation involving both their teenage sons, but there's so much bad blood that Paul and Claire, especially, seem totally unable to separate their own high emotions from the facts so that they can discuss the situation with open minds. By the end, I was shocked by the mindset of the main characters and found the whole storyline objectionable. Koch used an interesting format. While the characters are sitting at the dinner table, he also set the story against the courses of a formal meal, building the story to fit the appetizer, main course, etc. The "digestif" course was too hard for me to digest. I look forward to an interesting discussion at my F2F book club.</text></scrape>
