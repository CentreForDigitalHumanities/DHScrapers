The relations between the couples twist and turn as the evening progresses, until its shocking ending.What surprised me was how long it took for the conversation to turn to the event in particular. The majority of the novel was characterised by the narrator Paul's flashbacks to earlier family life and earlier events. There was a great deal that concerned himself and his own personality, and at the end of the day I felt this took away from what the central storyline. I understand the relevance that Paul's personality and actions had on the other characters in the novel, but at the end of the day I felt that this didn't have the same impact as I had hoped for.The characters for the most part are truly despicable, and it is very hard to empathise with them. I don't mind unlikeable characters - in fact some of my favourite books contain the most detestable characters - but I found the characters here to be almost unbeliveable. No one could be that rotten at their core, surely? I don't know, read it for yourself.I did still enjoy the story, and the ending was suitably shocking and violent, but I think my expectations were too fixed from the start. I'm looking forward to reading some more by Herman Koch though.</text></scrape>
