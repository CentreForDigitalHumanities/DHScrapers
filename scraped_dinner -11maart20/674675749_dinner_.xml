But I didn't hate it either. Found it pretty bland. I didn't like the characters and felt no connection to any of them. I found the narrative very egocentric. The way unimportant information was kept from the readers with the excuse of "not wanting to bore us" gave me the impression that Paul thought he was better than us. Pretty much the only thing I liked about the book was the relationship between Paul and Claire. The type of relationship that allows them communicate entire conversations with just a look. A small glance at each other tells them exactly what they are thinking. So basically I don't regret reading this book but I'm glad it only took 4 hrs to do so.</text></scrape>
