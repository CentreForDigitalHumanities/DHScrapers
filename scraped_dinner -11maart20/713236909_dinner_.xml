And, with just such a rationale, all manner of sick and sadistic idiocy becomes excusable.Recommendation: I’ll give this novel two-stars, but I’ll be damned if there’s anyone to whom I’d recommend it.“But we’re not talking here about civilized people. These are people everyone would be relieved not to have around anymore.”—page 210Adobe Digital [ePub] edition, 238 pages. On loan from: http://overdrive.colapublib.org/</text></scrape>
