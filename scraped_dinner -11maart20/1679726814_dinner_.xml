Check out my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfer...2.5 Stars Two brothers and their wives in Amsterdam meet at a fancy, high end restaurant to discuss the violent events that occurred revolving around their two 15 year old sons. I found this book rather frustrating. Although it was enjoyable to read at times, I found the vague writing to be very annoying. I know the author did this on purpose for the story but it drove me insane. I liked how the story was broken up into the courses of the meal and I think that it helped the tension grow through out the book. I hated every character in this book, they were all terrible people. I really enjoyed the first half of the book, I was very engaged in the story and I really wanted to know what the crime was. But, once the crime was revealed I felt the book slowed down too much for my liking. I also found the last 100 pages or so to drag on and I had to put the book down multiple times because I just didn't care.</text></scrape>
