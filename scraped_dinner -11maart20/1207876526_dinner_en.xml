It takes till about 25% of the book before we find out what the boys have been involved in, and yes it is shocking. Before this point the book just plods along and I found this quite boring. I did not like and could not warm to any of the characters and felt that they were very shallow people. Also their parenting skills left a lot to be desired.</text></scrape>
