Even a casual reader of crime and mystery novels has encountered amoral or psychopathic characters that are both memorable and compelling. You are not drawn into a Highsmith novel because the protagonist is an upstanding Samaritan, to put it simply.No. Instead, I wish to focus on why 'The Dinner' is a bad novel hiding behind the labels of literary fiction.***1. Convenient VaguenessOne of the most annoying features of Koch's novel is that, despite his frequent plot twists that are meant to shock the reader, he has a tendency of relying on vagueness to cover up the weaknesses in the narrative.For instance, one of the characters has been diagnosed with a mental illness, but Koch decides not to go into specifics save to say that the illness may be hereditary. This speaks more of the author's laziness more than anything else, like he was afraid of committing himself to doing basic research because, since this is meant to be a satirical novel, details don't matter.The narrative's vagueness comes back to rear its ugly head multiple times as more plot twists are revealed, mainlly because Koch does not bother to follow up on certain plot points, leaving them hanging in the air unresolved and ultimately weakening the narrative.So here is a least of questions:-What do Paul and Claire Lohman do to earn an income?-When did Claire get out of the hospital?-Why is Paul not in jail or on probation for his frequent assaults on other people?-Why does Serge still continue to interact with his brother despite being nearly beaten to death by him?-If Paul's unspecified mental illness is hereditary, does that mean that Serge could have it?-Do the Dutch authorities have no records on an unemployed history teacher with a known history of violent outbursts?-Why have the Lohmans not been sued into bankruptcy by the assault victims?***2. Bad SatireTo argue that this is meant to be a work of satire ultimately does nothing to address the inconsistent logic and multiple plot holes that arise in the novel. The narrative keeps bouncing back and forth between a sort of gritty realism and a cartoonish black comedy.The two couples want to keep the crimes of their children a secret, which is why they choose to gather at a public place and argue loudly about what to do. The narrative keeps trying to argue that all four main characters are complicit but does absolutely NOTHING to explain why Serge is guilty of anything or is somehow equally repellant as Paul, Claire or Babette.The author keeps trying to downplay his characters' nationality to make his novel somewhat universal in nature, but does not realize that the setting actually contributes to political and social context that becomes relevant. For instance, the idea of the death penalty being universally repellant is distintly a European position and thus the argument that somehow support for such a policy is an abnormality and thus a sign of an unhealthy mind will not work on an American audience. Thus the satire in this regard is limited to Dutch sensibilities and therefore not universal. The same goes to the justice system, which in the Netherlands is far more lenient on delinquents and criminals than America. Thus the constant whinging that guilty delinquents may have to spend a whole *gasp* two years in jail before being put on probation is laughable to many Americans.***3. They Would Never Get Away With ItMuch like 'Saturday' is a terribly executed home invasion thriller drowning in McEwan's purple prose, 'The Dinner' is a terribly executed crime novel with multiple open ends that cause the narrative to fall apart.Koch tries to use Youtube as part of a plot point and believes that somehow a video of a violent crime can just be 'erased from the internet'. Pfft, yeah, okay. Or that websites would not contact the proper authorities if they have information about a crime. Or that a user cannot be tracked down, particularly if a character is not established as even knowing what an IP address is.Blackmail is also frequently used in an inept fashion, as the characters somehow assume that just paying off somebody once means they will never come back to extort you again.The children's faces are captured by security cameras and then broadcast on a national news network. Despite the author's protests, yes, the children will eventually be recognized. The author also tries to limit the investigative abilities of the police for narrative convenience.And lastly, the entire premise of the novel being the discussion of a terrible crime in an upscale restaurant is ultimately idiotic in how absurd it is. The idea of conspirators being so risky as to potentially betray themselves in public instead of discussing the matter in the privacy in their own home is idiotic.***Don't read this novel. You will lose brain cells.</text></scrape>
