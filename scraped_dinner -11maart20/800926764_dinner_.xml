This is the story of a man out to dinner with his wife, his brother, and his brother's wife to discuss something that is up with their children. The story, which is first person, includes diversions and flashbacks which give the reader continually shifting perspectives on the narrator and all of the other characters, as well as the story that is involved. Some of the jacket blurbs call it a satire, but I am not certain that i see it. So: readable, but didn't really love it - and not sure that it shed any interesting light on anything for me, nor did I really connect on any sort of deep level or keep thinking about the book. (To be fair, I did read it on the plane.)random partly spoilery note: The friend with whom I am currently visiting in Edinburgh, asked if this book was about the Holocaust when I mentioned that it was Dutch. And you know, it's not entirely not.</text></scrape>
