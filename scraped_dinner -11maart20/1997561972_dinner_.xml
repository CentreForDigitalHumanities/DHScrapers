I almost threw it on the floor but then I remembered that I was reading it on my tablet. There is nothing likable about this book. The characters are a poor excuse of a decent human being, thinking they should be above the law because they are privileged. I'm amazed how more concern the parents were about protecting their family than actually doing the right thing; no remorse, no conscious, no owning up to your actions. To make things worse, I don't understand what the purpose of going out to dinner to discuss a private matter was needed. Private matters should be discussed at home away from the public.... unless you want witnesses. HATED the ending. It made me sick how they were no repercussions and how no one seemed to put two and two together. Ugh! Don't see how this could be a movie since the majority of it takes place at a restaurant while offering flashbacks to one of the parent's past. My advice, skip it unless you can borrow it for free.</text></scrape>
