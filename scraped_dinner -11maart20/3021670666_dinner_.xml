The reveals are handled deftly and spaced well throughout the book. It keeps you rapt and follows along at a nice pace. I read it very quickly.Still, it was only a three-star experience for me. There are better books that deal with similar pitch-dark subject matter in a more psychologically sophisticated way. (view spoiler)[ This book is more like "Carnage" than the morally complex "We need to talk about Kevin." Also, the made-up disorder the father and son share really muddies the water IMO.  (hide spoiler)] At the end, I felt like there's little I could take away from this entertaining but deeply unpleasant book. Another note: Maybe it's by design, but the food seems atypically pedestrian for a restaurant of this type. Would a fine-dining temple really serve contemporary standard fare like goat cheese with corn salad and rocket, but in nouvelle cuisine servings? Maybe another indicator that the style of this novel is more sophisticated than the substance.</text></scrape>
