The subject matter of this discussion is something I don't want to spoil for you. There is some suspense here, and also a meditation on the genetics of savagery, and the lengths to which one will go to protect a family member, or a political career.The stuff I liked: The characterization of the narrator, Paul, the jealous, misanthropic brother. He comes just shy of being one of those narrators like Humbert Humbert; you don't like them, but you love their way with words. The flashbacks involving Paul were to me, the highlights of the book, and reveal who Paul really is when you see him outside the genteel setting of the restaurant. In fact, almost all the character work in this book is excellent, from the waiter on up. The description of the event the characters discuss is absolutely chilling.I liked the execution of the idea that people can be genetically predisposed to a violent nature. That monsters breed monsters. The book "Defending Jacob" played with that idea, but it told you about it, as opposed to showing you. "The Dinner" shows you.The thing I didn't like: the long, lingering passages about the meal itself. I had no interest whatsoever in brother Serge's eating habits. I had less interest in the constant reappearance of the waiter's pinkie finger. Or the description of the food. Or the trouble with the dessert. For God's sake, I get it! I get how the gentility of the characters' surroundings plays against the violence they're there to talk about. But after the first ten pages of said juxtaposition, I was over it and wanted to get on with it. To find out what happened and what would be done about it.The ending was a bit unsatisfying too. I was left in the dark about exactly what occurrences took place, and how they took place. Not in a good, literarily ambiguous sense, but in a "WTF just happened?" sense.Let me end by remarking on something that's been discussed regarding this book. A lot of people don't like books without likable characters. I warn those people not to read this book, because there are no likable characters. For me, the characters don't have to be likable. But the book has to be compelling. My three star review reflects that the book was compelling in parts, but that in other parts it wasn't. </text></scrape>
