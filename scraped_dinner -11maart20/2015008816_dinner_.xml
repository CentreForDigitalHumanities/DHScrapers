If I had judged this book on the first 25 or even 50 pages, I might not have stuck with it. My first impression was that Paul was the "nice" brother suffering through a dinner with his pompous politician brother. It's an interesting and intricately woven story from his perspective, and a reminder that most people don't tell a story wherein they are the villain. It's subtle enough at first and I found myself rooting for him and empathizing with his fear for his son and his righteous indignation toward his brother. I also found myself really wanting him to stand up to his brother. He glosses over the incident that caused him to lose his teaching job, but that is the moment in the story when a little antenna goes up that perhaps Paul is not the good guy and his story. Then the story about the broken window shows how Paul has modeled violent behavior for Michel. Serge is revealed to have a heart and a conscience. To the point that he's willing to sacrifice his career and reputation to make it right. Around "Dessert" the inevitable end to the story begins to come into focus. The author builds suspense and dread masterfully. The biggest surprise for me was that Claire ultimately trumps both her husband and her son both in ferocity and deviousness. I was shaken by the story and when Michel hugs Paul and whispers "Dear old Dad", I had to suppress a shudder. Seems to me that this could easily lend itself to a sequel. Whey becomes of a teenager who gets away with something like this? More to the point, whose parents use any means necessary to help him get away with it? *Shudder*</text></scrape>
