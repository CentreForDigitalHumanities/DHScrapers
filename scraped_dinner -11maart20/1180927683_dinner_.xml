Are you ultimately to blame for your child’s actions? I devoured this book and I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s ripe for a lot of interesting discussion (great for a book club!), but there’s not much I can say without spoiling the experience. You really need to learn all the details just exactly as Koch so expertly reveals them: slowly over the course of this devilishly twisted book. It’s the structure, letting out bits and pieces of the present day problem in between revealing memories from the past, that really makes the book work so well. It ramps up the tension as you become more and more impatient to get the whole story. There’s humor (Paul’s feelings toward his brother and pretentious restaurants; his, um,…. teaching methods), but this is a look at the dark & uglies that can lurk at the heart of a seemingly ordinary family. Although taken to an extreme here, I’m frankly alarmed by the extant to which I identify with some of Paul’s thoughts & feelings. (Don’t look at me like that! I said some.) This is a perfectly paced, suspenseful read. I loved every word of it.</text></scrape>
