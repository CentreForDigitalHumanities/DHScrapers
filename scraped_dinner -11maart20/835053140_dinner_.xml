Taken as satire, though, the novel was more intriguing and quite funny. I won’t go into my interpretations of the story and its events because that would take forever so I’ll just give some general impressions.I loved Paul and his family. I thought they were adorable. I am getting tired of “NATURE VERSUS NURTURE” discussions in literature – I just don’t find it an enjoyable subject matter to read about anymore so whenever it comes up I find it so banal. As I read the novel I thought the medical aspects were just awful on all levels, especially because they soar to science fiction heights. But I realized that they provide an interesting commentary on aspects of healthcare so I ended up appreciating them (abortion, genetic testing, heritability, psychiatric disorders, healthcare professionals and their scopes, etc.). I don’t know. It’s hard to explain how I felt about the book. The marketing for this novel is bizarre. Was this novel considered a mystery? I didn’t find the twists to be too outrageous or unexpected. In any case this novel isn’t like any mystery I’ve read. It was a fun, readable romp but this isn’t a novel that will stay with me for very long. </text></scrape>
