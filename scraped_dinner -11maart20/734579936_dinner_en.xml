Paul and Serge, and their wives, Claire and Babette, meet for dinner in a swanky restaurant in Amsterdam. Each of the couples has a 15-year-old son and, we discover, the dinner has been arranged to discuss a horrifying act perpetrated by the two boys.What follows is a shocking tale, and I don’t use that phrase lightly. This is not a simple tale of the boy’s transgressions but a journey back through time showing how earlier actions led to the need to have the dinner.I found this book thought-provoking although it wasn’t what you could call an entirely enjoyable read. In short there were moments when I was genuinely shocked at the revelations on the page in front of me. I found it disturbing how my sympathy for the various characters changed totally with each piece of information, casually revealed. The root of this tale of how far should a parent go to protect their child? A ‘What would you do?’ sort of story. A look at what happens when certainties of middle-class are shattered but it is also more than that, an example of how the surface of a family can hide much darker undertones.</text></scrape>
