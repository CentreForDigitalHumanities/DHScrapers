While even from the beginning, Paul is unlikable and unrelatable, I still had inertia to accept that the main character was a psychopath (my assumption was that even if a main character doesn't start out as the hero, they normally end that way). I also believe this is the first book I have read set in the Netherlands, which I think of as peaceful and happy. For those two reason, it was quite surprising to have Paul's true nature slowly revealed.There were some boring parts to the book, but they were forgivable because I believed they served the purpose of hiding (and yet also revealing in hindsight) Paul's nature. However, the ending felt anticlimactic in execution. It was also hard to believe that the women would have the same lack of a moral compass as Paul and his son who both had a medical disorder. Due to that and the depressing subject matter of the book, I didn't enjoy it enough to give it more stars. Also, after reading, I saw it was based on a true story https://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/16/... So that's pretty horrific...</text></scrape>
