The way your allegiance as a reader shifts from character to character is fun, and the slowly cultivated sense of dread is intriguing, but by the time you get to the dirty secrets they just don't seem that dirty anymore. The rumination on violence and its justification are more interesting but I didn't feel they were full plumbed, or perhaps they were over my head. Maybe the half-reasonable violence was just a way to lead you to the point where the seemingly psychotic characters don't seem that psychotic. Many of the details about conversation and fancy dinners were acute and amusing, particularly the bit about TV and film being the last resort of an exhausted discussion (not sure that's universally true, but it's certainly happened to me). Since all the back cover blurbs seem to describe it as a thrilling beach read, I will say I enjoyed it way more than Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Much better writing for one. Lacking, however, in sandwiches.</text></scrape>
