You never like the people in the show and you hope see at least one get called on their bad behavior. This is a story of 2 couples who meet for a ridiculous exclusive and expensive dinner. Each character is a personality flaw with little else (Babette cries or yells, there is little in-between). Even the minor characters (talking about the kids) sound entitled and ignorant. But hey, maybe you like to read about horrible people. Who am I to stop you?</text></scrape>
