They're all just a bunch of psycho, rich, egocentric as*), protecting their psycho offspring. I am more than capable of setting aside my own bias and enjoying a tale on the dark side, but it has to be well written. I found the writing style of this author jarring, the constant reference to places, names and situations in which the narrator would go on and on about but then not want to mention the actual name of the disease or person was infuriating. The ending was so bad and contrived I felt like I got robbed of the time I wasted reading this book.</text></scrape>
