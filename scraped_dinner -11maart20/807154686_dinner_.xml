"The Dinner" starts promisingly enough, skewering the pretentious, expensive restaurant where only a prominent politician can get a reservation and where the manager's pinky finger comes closer and closer to the food with each course as he explains its provenance in minute detail. But the four people at the table -- the candidate for high office, his brother and their wives -- haven't come for the food or for a convivial night out. They've come to discuss a serious matter -- a horrific act committed by their teen-age sons. It seems like a trite setup for the agonizing moral conflict of doing the right thing vs. protecting their children. But as the meal proceeds and as revealed via flashbacks, we realize that we aren't in the midst of a moral dilemma, we're in crazy land and what might have been unlikable but still interesting characters are just monsters and "The Dinner" is just distasteful.</text></scrape>
