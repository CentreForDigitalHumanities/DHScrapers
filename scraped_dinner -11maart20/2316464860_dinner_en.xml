The rage-filled narrator and everyone else featured in the story is awful, monstrous even, psychopathic. I got bored around the 40% point, and finished this only because I had to for my book club. I appreciated that the author was asking questions about who is actually valuable in society and what kinds of behaviour are acceptable, but I found that he let his PoV character just go on too long.</text></scrape>
