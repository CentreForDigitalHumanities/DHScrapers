I was first sucked in by the intriguing synopsis promising, "a European Gone Girl." I was then wowed by the big display at Barnes & Noble. Basically, I wholeheartedly bought into the media hype. For god's sake, I took part in the hype recommending, "The Dinner," by Herman Koch to friends before actually reading it myself. NOTE TO SELF: do not do this again! To state it in simplest terms, this book was boring. I was expecting this novel to be of the, "slow burn," variety. I had prepared myself for a plot consisting of a tense situation that tediously worked its way up to a gratifyingly explosive ending. Unfortunately, by the time this reader got to the so-called, "explosive ending", I didn't give a crap. And here are some reasons why....In the beginning, I found the idea of an entire novel that takes place in one setting to be an awesome opportunity for character development. Unfortunately for this reader, I ended up loathing all of the characters. In fact, I could not decide which character I disliked the most, which may have been Herman Koch's ultimate intention. If not, I fear the idea of which one of these despicable people he intended a reader to relate to.Not only was the character development of this story downright bleak, the plot was extremely abstract. Multiple semi interesting altercations occured during the characters' "Dinner" together. However, I felt the author taunted me with these events and the false promise that the ultimate reasons behind them would be revealed. In the end I realized that upon finishing, "The Dinner," by Herman Koch I had learned more about the characters' menu at the resturant than I did about the actual reasons they were there. So if ever asked in the future if I would like seconds at this "Dinner", my answer would most definitely be, "I'll pass." </text></scrape>
