Which says a lot being that I knew going in that this was a book that took place over the course of one dinner. Aptly named. That being said, for whatever reason, I was not expecting such a suspenseful book! One would think that an entire book about one dinner might seem like it could be boring, but it really wasn't.I don't know exactly what genre this would be categorized as, but I think the term psychological thriller says it best. There was a movie too. (tho some of the character names were different.) I read Herman Koch's 'Dear Mr. M' first a year or two ago, and I was actually impressed. I'd read quite a bit of negative reviews on it, but I found it to be surprisingly compelling for being a seemingly average, slow paced slice of life kind of book. But it's more than just every day life with Koch, there's sort of a demented streak in him. It was about the sometimes twisted side of regular people. A theme that seems to be prevalent in his books considering I would categorize this in almost exactly the same way. Dear Mr. M was a tad bit more domestic, while The Dinner had more of a thriller vibe to it.In the Dinner, Paul and Claire are happily married with a son, Michael. Or so it seems. What initially seems like a rare case of wedded bliss, where Paul is a successful, attractive man who is still very much in love with his wife of 15+ years, soon begins to show signs of something else-something sinister. Almost immediately Koch drops the hook. In a flashback, we see Paul looking for Michael before leaving for dinner. Michael is MIA, but he has left his phone on his desk. Naturally, like any caring, invested parent, it piques his curiosity. He picks it up, flips through the texts and videos, and then finds something that stops him in his tracks. Makes him go cold deep inside. What did he find? it's the question that plagues us for the first half of the book. I figured it had to be a video of him doing something, possibly raping somebody? Killing somebody? Committing some type of crime? Paul jumps up when he realizes Michael is coming and hurries to come up with an excuse for why he was in his room. He awkwardly and pointedly avoids bringing up whatever it is that he has just seen, retreats to his bedroom, then leaves for dinner with Claire.What struck me as odd though is the way Paul guiltily hurries out of Michael's room and lies about having seen it. As if he were the kid and Michael was the one with the control. Wouldn't any parent who found something incriminating in his/her kid's phone immediately confront their child? If a parent's dominant feeling is one of guilt, then the roles between parent and child are a bit skewed wouldn't you say? But not in The Dinner. Here, Michael holds an inordinate amount of power and authority. A kid should have no authority, and that should be cut and dry and that's clearly not the case with Paul who seems to be desperate not to upset his son.As the title hints at, everything revolves around this one dinner that for most of the book is looming in the very near future. A dinner between Paul, his wife Claire, his brother Serge, and Serge's wife Babette that Paul and Claire are very obviously dreading. We get some flashbacks peppered in which set up the storyline for what is the purpose of the dinner, but for the most part we are in the present, and in the present Claire and Paul are getting ready to go to dinner. The getting to the dinner part of the book seems to drag on a bit, but I was hooked. I sped through the chapters and was dying to find out all the details behind what Paul saw and what had happened between Paul's finding whatever was in Michael's phone, and the dinner's conclusion. At some point it's revealed that what he found was a video of Michael and his cousin abusing a homeless person. Being violent. Reckless. Cruel. It is also revealed a little further down the line that Paul saw a video on the evening news that he recognized of his son, security footage of two unknown kids abusing a homeless person and ultimately killing her by throwing a gas can into the small doorway of the atm and lighting it with the person inside. So when Paul goes looking through Michael's phone, he already knows what he's looking for. He already knew with the certainty of a parent recognizing his child that that was Michael in the video, the only question was whether or not Michael had any evidence of the crime in his phone, which he finds is to the affirmative.The point from which they get to the dinner to the dinner's end slows up quite a bit. A lot more is revealed to us from that point on, we discover that Michael's accomplice was his cousin, who is Serge and Babette's biological son, but also that their other adopted son was also present during the attack and is now blackmailing the boys for money and threatening to publicly post the video he has showing the boys clearly and outing them for who they are. We discover that Serge is a candidate for the upcoming presidential election. We discover that sometime in the past Claire has gotten very sick, we assume it's cancer but it's never specified, it was a time Claire that spent in the hospital, frail and hovering at death's door. We discover that there is something strange going on with Michael, tho this also is never specified. Some mental illness that is manifesting in strange ways. Black outs. Outbursts. Strange behavior. And then by the end we have discovered that Claire, who Paul had previously thought completely clueless and so had kept info from, was actually aware of Michael's actions and so had also been keeping information from Paul, thinking him to be in the dark.When Serge announces his plan to drop out of the presidential race and bring in his son to confess to his crime, everybody else at the table is resistant. Nobody other than Serge thinks that there is any need to confess, but he insists that not only is the burden too much for these young boys to carry, but believes that it will come out eventually and it will be better for them sentencing wise if they came forward on their own and showed repentance. He explains his plan to drop out of the race publicly after dinner, with the press at a nearby cafe. Everybody else at dinner is adamantly opposed, but Serge holds firm to his plan. It is at this point that Claire's true nature begins to be unveiled. Up until this point Paul had been responsible for describing her to us, and through his eyes we saw a much more morally sound woman. I think even Paul ends up surprised with what his wife is capable of. But when Claire asks Paul to hurt Serge, punch him, give him a black eye, break his nose, something minor yet not insignificant, Paul is at once both appalled and awed by her. She on the other hand knows that the one thing that might keep Serge from going on air is if something were off with his appearance. But Paul is hesitant, and Claire takes things into her own hands and before Paul even realizes what happens he is being stopped by police, corralled to the side, watching his wife being led to the police car in handcuffs. And then yet another reveal after all this seems like it's being wrapped up is when Paul finally puts together two and two. Earlier he had found a text from Claire to Michael saying something along the lines of, "do it tonight it's a perfect time for it. Don't tell dad because he doesn't know anything." I think at first Paul assumed it had something to do with the crime that had already been committed. Then he goes home and runs into Michael, who's normal but for the blood on his ear... and then the suspicious disappearance of Serge and Babette's adopted son...(the black mailer) that he realizes the exact nature of the text exchange between mother and son. When he inquires, Michael responds nonchalantly, confirming with his demeanor. The book ends strangely and sort of anticlimactically. Paul responding to all the events and discoveries with a confused and forced smile, as if in a daze. I was up and down with my reaction and feelings about this book. I was super excited and stoked on it the first half, but it slowed down drastically in the second. What began as more of a thriller turned more into a character study, and ended up somewhere right in the middle of the two. I think Koch is talented, I really do. He has a way of writing about people that is both smart, and juicy. I think a lot of the time, smarts are sacrificed for scandal and juice, but that is not the case with 'The Dinner'. There's obvious skill, it's smart without being pretentious, accessible without being easy. The writing flows, and it's easy to keep turning the pages, particularly in the first half. He does an impeccable job with the hook, and keeps us going till the end with a bird trail of info crumbs. My complaints are all with the second half. Not only did it slow down, and the thing that happens that one probably imagines would happen when you're reading a book that takes place entirely over the course of one dinner. And thats that it starts to drag a little. But the ending was such a shock to the systems that looking back on it after reading it a couple weeks ago, it's hard to remember why or how I felt bored.I wasn't pleased with the ending, I thought it left things too open ended and I'm definitely one of those people who like neat and tidy endings. I think the point though was to call attention to the matter of conscience and guilt. It's one thing to be a mother and willing to do everything to protect your son. You would tell any lie to keep your son out of harm's way. But out of jail? That's another thing, that's escaping consequence. But most of us would lie, cheat, maybe even steal to keep our kids from having to spend their lives behind bars. As long as we were personally sure that our son/daughter was not actually bad right? But what if you couldn't be sure. How do you face the issue of your kid being a potential threat or danger to people? Where does maternal loyalty end and your duty to society begin? Or does it? It's a very difficult issue to consider. We might know what's right, but we also know that a person's children is their greatest weakness. The issues and feelings that Paul grapples with are understandable. It's more his immediate reactions that seem odd. He gives almost no reaction at all. If we weren't in his head, we wouldn't know at all whether hiding this type of behavior and being involved in the covering up of a crime has any weight. Is he able to just go on his merry way without lending so much as a second thought to what he'd done or what he knows? Michael seems to be able to. All nonchalance and smiles. Claire as well. Never wavering in her determination to ensure it doesn't come out. Not nearly as affected as Paul would have expected her to be by the knowledge of her son's crimes. Only Paul and Serge seem to have any feelings of guilt or remorse. Though Serge's hesitation may stem from fixation on his public image, and Paul's guilt seems to be absent, and in it's place some distant awareness that he should be guilty. He seems removed from his actions and feelings, perhaps it's a defense mechanism, or maybe it has something to do with whatever mental illness Koch hints at, or maybe Paul is actually sociopathic and devoid of a conscience and any sense of right of wrongdoing, the way Claire and Michael seem to be. Or maybe that's the point, for us to explore the depth of their feelings and question moral obligation. That's quite deep. Maybe it's not that deep at all, and they're all sociopathic assholes. That sounds about right.And anyway, all thoughts aside on the story. I just have to say... that cover is BEA-U-Ti-FUL! It's one of my all time favorite covers, and you really need to see it in person, in paperback form to truly understand just how gorgeous it really is!</text></scrape>
