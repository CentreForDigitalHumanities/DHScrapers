So that made it intriguing. It took a while to get going but the second half of the book redeems itself a little but not enough to warrant more than 3⭐️Pretty much all the characters are detestable but I think that might be the point, but not any less irksome. Worth a read for a bit of discussion after it and I did actually fancy seeing the movie but that looks like it’s been panned so probably won’t bother now!</text></scrape>
