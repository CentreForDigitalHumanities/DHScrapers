The vehicle for telling the story is innocuous enough - a nice dinner out with family - but the contrast of the fancy restaurant with the horrifying story magnified the intensity of the violent act. The novel asks us to question what we would do for family and how what our children see in us affects their behavior and attitudes.</text></scrape>
