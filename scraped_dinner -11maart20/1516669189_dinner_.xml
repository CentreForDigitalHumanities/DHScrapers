I didn't want to experience feeling disturbed. Then it got choosen for book club. One friend said "I can't decide if I love it, or hate it." my friends who have read this book have rated it between 3 and 5 stars. I debated between 3 or 4. Is it good book that makes you uncomfortable? Yes. Do assholes like this really exist? Yes. And that's what I find terrifying. It's not just fiction. People think this way, and act this way. Thats the point of book clubs, right? To get you reading things you wouldn't normally? To challenge you to get out of your comfort zone? To give you a common topic to discuss? I'm torn on whether I would recommend this book.</text></scrape>
