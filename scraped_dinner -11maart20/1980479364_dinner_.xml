It wasn't just that the moral compass of every single character is busted - I could have overlooked that. My main complaint is that over half of the book was a flashback (as far as I could tell) and I just did not buy it. The flashback did help with the plot line, but it was totally unnecessary for it to consume that much of the text. In short - save yourself a few hours of reading and see the movie - or don't do either, and your life will be the same. </text></scrape>
