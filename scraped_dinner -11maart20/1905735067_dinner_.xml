The characters were incredibly unlikeable, pretty much every single one of them. They were spoiled, pretentious and uninteresting. I think a few of them were sociopaths. The story was mind numbingly boring for at least 90 - 95% of the book. I made the mistake of listening to the audiobook and it sounded like even the narrator was bored by the sheer number of times he sighed while narrating. The only time he didn't sound bored was every single time he said the name Serge, because he overdid it so much every time he said that name. I rolled my eyes every single time he said it - I found it very obnoxious. There didn't seem to be any resolution in the book and I felt like I had no idea what was happening at the end, but that could just be because I had tuned out and just couldn't wait for it to be over. This book had been on my TBR list for quite awhile and I really wish I had read some of the Goodreads reviews beforehand and just left it there. I feel like the one star I gave it is generous...would not recommend to anyone.</text></scrape>
