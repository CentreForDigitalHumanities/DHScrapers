It's an ambitious and awesome blend of suspense, social commentary and satire.Koch is a terrific writer. While he doesn't write with the briliant wordplay of Nabokov (that's not Koch's style) there's a tone and a way with the material that reminds me of Nabokov. And he creates suspense with the skill of Hitchcock, who also had that wink-wink thing going while he was terrifying the audience. They also both excelled at the unreliable narrator, as does Koch with his unforgettable Paul.And it's relevant. Even more relevant today than when it was originally published in 2009. And it's probably going to take on greater relevance with time, like "A Clockwork Orange" or "Lord of the Flies."It's a page-turner that lives up to its promise as well as its publicity -- a surprising and thought-provoking, totally unique read. I can't stop thinking about it.</text></scrape>
