I really, really enjoyed it. Sometimes I don't like when I don't like the characters but not this time! Who's to say what parents will do to protect their kids when they've done something really bad but wow, didn't see that coming! I can see how some people think it moves a little slow (I did too sometimes) but it was also a page turner. Can it be both? Once again, really enjoyed this!</text></scrape>
