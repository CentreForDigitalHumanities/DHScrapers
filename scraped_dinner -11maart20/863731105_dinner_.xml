The Dinner belongs to a totally different calibre. If one has to compare it to something, then I'd say, reading it conjures up Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. Are there really some in our society who think themselves so superior that they ought to be above the law? The law, after all, is a human construct. When can we bend it to serve our own interest, when the interest is out of love for our son, or husband, or wife? The book deals with subjects that are soul-searching: The dichotomy between nature and nurture. How much of our being and psyche is hereditary? What portions of our actions are a result of our own waywardness as lost souls? How can we love our family yet hate everyone else?To start off, it's a very original concept for the author to parallel the story development with a gourmet dinner two couples are having in an upscale restaurant. The Ap√©ritif and the Appetizer are the foretaste of what we will get for the Main Course. What appears to be petty disgruntled complaints and personal biases of the husband/father in the early chapters turn out to be only light appetizers for the main course where a horrific crime is revealed. The horror though isn't limited to the crime per se. It is chilling to read how everyone involved deals with the aftermath. The main course is a knock-out thriller based on a real-life crime. Its straight-forward descriptions written with almost journalistic detachment, and incisively observed as the notes of a perceptive psychoanalyst. This is more than a thriller though, for the moral dilemma or the lack of it is what makes the book provocative and thought-provoking. I don't think we are expected to 'like' or even 'identify' with any of the characters; hopefully, after reading it, we just might think a little deeper into issues concerning our humanity, or the lack of it, in ourselves, and in the little humans we bring up. How much are our children a result of our parenting and examples, how much are their own choosing and decisions? Can heredity excuse us from our errors? If Freud were around today, he would be reading this book. </text></scrape>
