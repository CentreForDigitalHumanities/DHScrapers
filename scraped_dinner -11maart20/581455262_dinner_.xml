I hate the timing of the narration, I hate the shift from present to past, past to present, I hate the unsaid details that the narrator claims were not important or were too personal, I HATE the end, I dislike all of the main characters and I feel like there were too many incomplete story lines built into this piece. I think maybe this story would have worked better either as a short story/novella, or as a lengthier book, but with a new organization and structure.</text></scrape>
