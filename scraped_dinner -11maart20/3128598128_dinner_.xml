This is the first-ever one-star review I have ever given, and I would bet it is my last one-star review. I rarely ever read a book as terrible, terrifying and harmful as The Dinner. We hear the story through the voice of Paul, husband to Clair and father to Michael. Paul and I guess Michel and in the end, even Clair are violent and disturbed people. What makes this book harmful is that at one point in the book we find out that Paul was diagnosed with a "condition" that is obvious in amniocentesis testing and can be managed with medication. Paul can not remember the name of the condition but remembers it has a German-sounding name in relation to the name of the psychologist who first identified the condition. This has led more than a few people to believe he has Asperger syndrome, though the author says he made up the condition. But nevertheless, many readers assume he has Asperger syndrome. Asperger Syndrome can not be managed with medication and is not evident in amniocentesis testing, none the less, many readers are assuming the "condition" is Asperger syndrome. It is not. A man who is going around beating people to a pulp and turning a blind eye to horrific things both his son and wife (and nephew) do is alluded to having Asperger syndrome in this book. It is proven that people with Asperger syndrome are NOT more violent than the rest of the population. Paul, his wife and son lack remorse and are very violent, they are psychopaths at best. There is something really wrong with them, but it is not Asperger Syndrome. "Asperger’s and ViolenceIndeed, psychologists and psychiatrists agree that people with autism or Asperger’s are not more likely to commit violent crimes than members of the general population, but they say in very rare cases, it can happen."This book pushes a stereotype that is untrue and unkind to people trying to live, or trying to live with their children who have Asperger Syndrome. In the world we live in, with people struggling with all kinds of mental health issues, why in the world do we have a book pushing an outdated and unresearched stereotype? Yes, my son was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome back when it was still a diagnosis (it has been removed from use now, but those diagnosed before this, are still labeled with Asperger Syndrome) The only thing my son would threaten you with is the ability to take over the world with his off the chart math abilities.More likely he has the Murder Gene, but readers still seem to assume Asperger Syndrome. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoami...Also are we to believe that a man who beats his son's school principal to a pulp, sending him to the hospital with missing teeth and with a bashed-in face is just allowed to go home and walk around with no consequences? He can hit his brother in the face with a frying pan? Clair can mess up her BIL's face with a broken wine glass to the point that there are actual holes left in his face after 3 surgeries? Is this what it is actually like in The Netherlands? If so... I suggest no one ever go visit The Netherlands.  I used to work for a man from The Netherlands, and I have a few friends who live there, and honestly, none of them seem overly violent. But while the author lives there, he has no problem portraying a family of psychopaths beating people, killing people, harassing people, all with literally NO CONSEQUENCES. I guess Herman Koch doesn't mind throwing his country under the bus along with all of the people with Asperger Syndrome. Terribly written, harmful stereotypes and disturbing subjects. If you are into that and want a peek into the mind of one disturbed man... then read The Dinner. Otherwise, save your time and money, this book has no redeeming qualities and not one likable character.</text></scrape>
