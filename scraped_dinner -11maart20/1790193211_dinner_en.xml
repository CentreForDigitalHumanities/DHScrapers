The setting, characters and the deeper story within all worked together to create an intense psychological thriller. The premise and setting: The story takes place over the course of a dinner at a posh restaurant in Amsterdam. At the dinner parents from two families meet to discuss their sons who seem to have done something criminal. Koch slowly unwinds the plot through flashbacks, narrator's perspective and the dialogue, but what was intriguing is how parallel to course of the dinner is to our own experience of the story as readers. Interruptions in the face of the talkative waiter and other distractions cause a lot of impatience, both to the reader and the narrator. By the end of the book you really get shocked by the unfolding of the events and the truth behind the meeting. The characters: As has been said many times, all the characters in this book are the worst of kind. In fact, you'd think you favor one character to the other, but by the end of the book you realise you hate them all and you hate their guts. Personally it was fascinating to see my own reactions once I realised it I don't particularly care about any of the characters and wouldn't mind if the whole restaurant crashed into a pile. Koch has done an excellent job at exposing the innerworkings of the insidiously evil mind and laying out stereotypes for us to question and understand. The writing style: I overall felt quite impatient while reading the book because the conversations are so disruptive, but that does not necessarily mean it's bad. I loved reading the book but kinda wish I had done so on a brighter day because it kind of played with my mood too! Anyhow, overall I think it's a brilliant psychological thriller and I'm eager to read Koch's upcoming novel Mr M. I highly recommend to mature audiences.</text></scrape>
