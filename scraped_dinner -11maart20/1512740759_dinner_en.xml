There was not one single likeable character in this novel. So if you need/demand likeable characters, look elsewhere, you won't find them here.Two couples meet at a very exclusive Amsterdam restaurant. Paul and Claire Lohman and Serge and Babette Lohman. Serge is a famous politician, likely to become the next prime minister. Most of the novel takes place over dinner in the restaurant. While waiting for his brother and his wife to arrive, Paul, our narrator, makes all sort of interesting observations about the restaurant, about his wife and especially about his brother whom he seems to resent greatly. The most unsettling thing, for me anyway, was that these characters were upper middle-class people, who in theory, should be better than what they were. As the novel progresses, their true selves slowly show themselves to reveal psychopathic personalities. I love when a novel challenges my morals, preconceived ideas and especially when it makes me question certain things. The Dinner did that and more. Impressive - in a disturbing kind of way.</text></scrape>
