Found this one while going through my Audible backlist, remembered I DNF’d it years ago and decided to give it another shot. Worse than I remembered. Honestly, if there hadn’t been the heavy handed implication that Paul had Aspergers and would have been aborted if he parents had known (I mean, WTF) and that was why he was a sociopath instead of just implying that he was a sociopath/psychopath I would have given it 2-3 star and said it just wasn’t my taste. But that pretty much ruined it for me. Also don’t understand why Serge continued to associate with his brother after he hit him in the face with a frying pan. </text></scrape>
