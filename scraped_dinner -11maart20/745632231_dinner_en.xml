Anything of import is related very matter-of-factly, as though it really doesn’t matter, and we are told that anything of a personal nature is none of our business. As a reader, I can understand an author telling everyone else that it is none of their business, but aren’t I supposed to feel like I am the special one that the author is speaking to and taking into his confidence? I didn't.This book became rather tiresome for me. I was sick of Paul’s extraneous musings long before we finally got to the “meat” of the story. (And unfortunately, the meat wasn’t very much!) Over and over again they served as a distraction, and mostly did nothing for me other than interrupt the narrative. My mind kept screaming GET ON WITH THE STORY! I frequently felt disconnected to the story, and consequently had no emotional investment.(view spoiler)[Too many things just did not make sense to me.•	Why in God’s name would they have picked such a popular and busy restaurant, where Serge is so well-known, to hold such an intimate and private conversation.•	When exactly were Claire and Paul going to admit to each other that they knew about the ATM incident? Why would they even have agreed to meet with Serge and Babette? I got the impression that everyone knew what the dinner was going to be about.•	Why didn’t Serge have any scars from his earlier altercation with Paul, when he got bashed in the face with a hot frying pan? Burns leave horrible scars.•	I thought that Serge was going to have Rick confess, then he was going to resign his candidacy for Prime Minister… what happened to all that? Why would Claire gouging him with some broken glass act to change his mind? I thought he was doing this so that Rick could have some kind of future? Not important anymore? (hide spoiler)]I was left wondering if there really could be a nice, “normal” family like this one? I hope not. They are all completely whack-o.Read with SBC book club October 2014</text></scrape>
