It was sort of like certain designer glasses, glasses that add nothing to the personality of the person wearing them; on the contrary, they draw attention first and foremost to themselves: I am a pair of glasses, and don't you ever forget it!" However I couldn't reconcile the plot device on which it all hinged with reality: if Michel's sociopathic tendencies were to be attributed to some kind of genetic trait which could have been identified in utero then this is a scientific theory unknown to me. If the reader is to believe this crucial plot development one would have to have entered into an understanding that the novel was a work of another genre, fantasy perhaps. Instead everything else was written with a focus on grim reality, it painted a very disturbing and accurate picture of the morality of our day. I was disappointed that Koch chose this as his great reveal. The story had so much going for it, it was shocking, disturbing, thought provoking and very relevant. The story itself raises questions we as a society need to be engaging with. </text></scrape>
