That alone is very misleading. The book was so full of mindless dribble and does not actually start the purpose of the story till the 90 pages in.I really truely dispised Claire and Paul. And maybe that had a lot to do with why I did not like the book. I can't say much without giving important details but I despised everything they stood for. They were straight off the kilter in so much denial it was pathetic. This story had so much potential but it had so much stupid nonsense as of the menu, the food, the wine. And hearing about the pinky finger was sheer annoyance.</text></scrape>
