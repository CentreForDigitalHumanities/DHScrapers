The meal starts in a fairly relaxed manner as the couples chat, and as the author casts an acerbic eye on upmarket restaurants and pretentious waiters. But gradually all humour and goodwill dissipates as the tension starts to build. The novel chronicles the conversation as the meal progresses. As the protagonists move towards discussing the incident that has brought them together, the reader learns through flashback, mobile phone conversations and “off-stage” conversations just how serious the matter is. Disagreement on how to deal with what the boys have done maintains the tension as the book builds to the surprising (at least to me) climax.This is a clever, well-paced and disturbing book. Much as books like We Need to Talk about Kevin do, the novel forces us to think about issues of parental responsibility, heredity, the parent-child relationship and the ambiguity inherent in moral judgements when they concern those we love. A short book, and easy to read, it nevertheless packs quite a punch, and is the sort of book that lingers long in the reader’s mind.As an interesting footnote, what the boys have done is based on a real-life incident that occurred in Spain some years ago, and there are some very interesting clips about the case on YouTube.</text></scrape>
