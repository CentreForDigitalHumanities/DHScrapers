Unfortunately, I kept thinking to myself, "wow, this could have been brilliant." Honestly, the premise of the plot was just really good . . .but I couldn't help but think of it in the hands of say, Stephen King. King would make the rather pedestrian protagonist both more likable and scarier. He would take this exact same plot and take you on an emotional roller coaster. Koch, on the other hand, takes his brilliant plot idea and overlays it with a solid storytelling voice and actually some sharp wit that keeps you turning the pages. And that was good enough for four stars from me. But just barely. I was interested and entertained, but not impressed.The story is about two brothers who meet up in a restaurant with their wives. It becomes clear that the relationship between the brothers is strained and slowly the causes of the strain are revealed. Some of the issues are narrated forthrightly and others need to be unearthed a bit by the reader as the story progresses. Readers can get behind characters who do bad things . . .but it takes a lot of writerly skill to develop the empathy in the heart of the reader that is sustained throughout. This book actually reminds me a little bit of a book I started and have yet to return to called The Slap . . .which took on some similar issues on a smaller scale and with a less deft hand.So I am glad I read this one, and I enjoyed the time I spent with it, but I don't think I'll be telling my friends to pick it up.</text></scrape>
