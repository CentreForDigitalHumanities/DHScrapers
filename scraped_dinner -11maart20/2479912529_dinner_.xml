I could find very little to relate with in the book and I was left wanting in the entertainment department as well. These characters are horrible with no sense of self or direction or compassion ... all they really did was rationalize horrible behavior (usually their own) and have no remorse for the things theyâ€™ve done. I felt like humanity was left outside the restaurant and that ATM booth. So disappointed. I really like works of fiction to grab my attention and take me on a mental or emotional roller coaster. All I really felt was irritation and contempt. </text></scrape>
