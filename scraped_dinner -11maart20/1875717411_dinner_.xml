It took me a month to complete because it was the type of book that required a particular state of mind. If you're the type of reader that believes in the goodness of humand kind, The Dinner might not be for you.It's incredibly honest in showing how filthy we humans can be sometimes. It also brings forth some ethical ideas that get you out of your comfort zone and make you question yourself. I caught myself thinking: 'This idea is terrible but it has a point'. The ending was a little overwhelming and seemed wrapped in a rush. </text></scrape>
