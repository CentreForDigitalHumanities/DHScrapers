Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in it's own way.” I enjoyed this for the most part, but it just wasn't enough. I felt like the author dragged on a lot when he was talking, and his thoughts seemed very jumbled... I hated how he jumped back and forth to different time periods. It was hard to determine when he was talking about the present and when he was recalling a past event, and it was hard to determine just how far back in time he was talking about, because he didn't go in order. It was confusing to hear him talking about an incident where his son was 6 years old, back to the dinner scene, and then a time when his son was 4 years old. It got tiring trying to decipher it all. Also, the authors lack of details may have been him trying to add to the suspense and mystery of the story, but it came across as lazy. To keep saying over and over that you "Don't want to talk about the illness my wife had..." or "Don't want to tell you the exact time this happened..." just makes it seem like you didn't feel like doing any actual research into your story. There was not enough action or plot twists to random talking ratio, and I didn't particularly like any of the characters, so I never really cared what happened to any of them. The ending was at least somewhat interesting and an almost satisfying conclusion, but that seemed rushed. You go on and on throughout your entire book about pointless filler and then unravel the big stuff within the last 40 or so pages. It feels like you sat in front of a computer, typed whatever popped into your head, and sent it to publishing. Did this book even go through editing? </text></scrape>
