I could understand and sometimes even emphasize with the main character and with his wife. The internal monologues by the main character himself are quire remarkable and I could understand his train of thoughts, as politically incorrect as they may be considered by many readers. The characters are all represented without any false moralism, in their full ambiguities and contradictions. The story itself does not follow the usual politically correct BS (which is now mandated by a few publishing companies): as an example one the characters, an adopted son from Burkina Faso, surprisingly does not end up playing the part of the good guy - and this is quite refreshing, to be honest.This is a book of moral complexity, not a wishy-washy, feel good book where the good always wins and everybody lives happily hereafter. I loved that the characters did not behave as "expected" - and the author makes no excuses for exposing the moral ambiguities of the characters, even if the author did know that this may upset some righteous reader.This book has been compared to "The Slap" by the Australian author Christos Tsiolkas, but this book is so much better than "The slap".Highly recommended to the intellectually honest who refuses to follow the current politically correct BS.</text></scrape>
