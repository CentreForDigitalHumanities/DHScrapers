And no, it didn't matter that they were unsympathetic! - I can accept that. I have the sense that this novel is being promoted in the US as a sort of thought-provoking devilishly clever morality play. But if it's a morality play then the sociopathy and malevolence toward immigrants and the homeless needed to be explored more (this is contemporary Europe, after all), and harder questions needed to be asked. So, instead, it struck me as even lighter than that - as a nasty "entertainment."I'm curious about the genetic abnormality afflicting the narrator and his son. An abnormality named after a neurologist with a German name, that would show up in amniotic fluid, that causes some people to terminate a pregnancy? Is it just sociopathy/psychopathy (which can't be detected by prenatal testing)? Is it made up? Klinefelter's doesn't fit. The closest I can find is XYY (or Jacob's syndrome) - but this hasn't anything to do with neurology (I think) and the medical establishment has worked to dispel inaccurate myths that it causes violent behavior. Koch's plot hinges on this diagnosis, and so if it's XYY he talking about then he'd be recklessly promoting the misunderstanding of a "normal" aneuploidy. I suppose that's a good reason to leave it unnamed. The problem for me is: if the father-son sociopathy is caused by this - or any genetic condition - then the reader doesn't really need to worry about the ethical questions it raises. (Which means the character Claire is really the most sinister, since her behavior is not reducible to a genetic explanation.)</text></scrape>
