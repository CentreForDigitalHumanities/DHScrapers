That is the question that keeps repeating over and over again in my head. This book takes place over the duration of a fancy dinner between two couples. Two couples that have a terrible secret they are keeping that involve their young sons. A secret that can ruin their sons lives as well as their own.I found this book to be very dark and disturbing. It was slow at the beginning but I think it had to be in order to really pack a punch at the end. Truly twisted.Actual rating 3.5 Stars.</text></scrape>
