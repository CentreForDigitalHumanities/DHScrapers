There were plenty of things that were merely implied but never stated. I don't even know if it was supposed to be a mystery book or not. I mean I sort of drew that conclusion because it was based on Michel killing a homeless person and that letting out that secret would basically affect the lives of everyone in the family especially Serge since he was in the lead for prime minister. I was not a big fan of the ending although, I'm having a hard time figuring out what Michel and his cousin did to Serge's adopted son if he was killed or badly hurt for blackmailing the boys about the incident. Overall, it reminded me why I usually do not read these mystery books, I am not drawn to them, or maybe I've just chosen some pretty bad ones. I love/hate the way Koch's style of writing, it almost feels like it's backward or something which makes you put much more thought into it, I assume its the fact that the book was translated, or maybe that's just the way he would write had it originated in English. </text></scrape>
