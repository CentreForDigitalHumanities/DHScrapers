The entire setting of the novel is at a dinner so I understand that there will be tangents but this was pretty awful. The writing was in stream of consciousness if the main character and so much of the content didn't seem to have anything to do with the story.

I ended up abandoning this book after 100 pages where absolutely nothing happened!</text></scrape>
