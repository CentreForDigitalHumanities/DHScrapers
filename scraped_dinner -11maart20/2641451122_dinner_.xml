There wasn't one enjoyable part to it. I wasn't so much bothered by the fact that the characters were completely unlikeable (I've read "Girl on the Train", a likeable character isn't necessary for enjoying a thriller like that); instead, I was bothered by how pathetic and predictable the ending was. I was bothered by how slow and meandering it was; how the writer would take us on long - and I do mean LONG - detours that seemingly lead nowhere. It was just such an odd, uncomfortable book to read. To the so-called "professional" reviewers who heaped endless praise on it â€¦ I have to ask all of you: Did we read the same book? </text></scrape>
