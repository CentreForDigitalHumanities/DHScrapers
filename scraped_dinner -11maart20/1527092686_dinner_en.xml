Great and disturbing, well written and unpleasant, raising a lot of questions and pushing limits. You get really a lot on the plate at The Dinner. Suspense? Check. Unreliable narrator? Check. Family secrets? Check. A lot of unanswered questions you get to figure out yourself? Check. Madness? Hard to say, but probably, in a way, so check yet again.While hating most of the characters in it I liked a lot the book itself. Paul's conversation with the psychologist didn't work for me, I mean does it change anything? Does it justify him? Anyone? I'm not so sure and it sounded like false tune to me a little bit, so half star off. But other than that - excellent book. Don't read it though if you feel depressed or have some resentment towards human kind - it will worsen it.</text></scrape>
