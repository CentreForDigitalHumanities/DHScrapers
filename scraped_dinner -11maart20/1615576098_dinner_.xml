I can take or leave an unlikable character, if the story's good and the characters attract me somehow. Yet, when you have a book where no one's likable without anything to show why you should invest in them, you have to give them the middle finger. This book has no redeeming quality. Gist of story: (view spoiler)[Enabling parents absolve their sons' involvement in a murder. Oh, and for the entire book, we're stuck at a damn restaurant discussing about food that somehow ended up tasteless with each passing page.  (hide spoiler)]Case closed. I was curious to read an unreliable narrator for a book I'm writing. But, damn. I want my readers to continue with the story. I almost dropped this one throughout its reading.Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Sip some tea, have a scone, and read another book.</text></scrape>
