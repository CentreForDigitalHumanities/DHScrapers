The parents have recognised their respective sons in some CCTV footage of a brutal crime, which is shown on television. One of the fathers is about to run as Prime Minister of Holland, the other is his resentful, belligerent brother and the discussion is around how to best protect their sons from the fall-out of their crime.The comparisons with "Kevin" are understandable and the translated (from the Dutch) prose is stylish and witty as it descends into the basest of human responses to the threat against ones young. The issues of mental health care, class differences and adoption are all alluded to, but ultimately I think this story lacks substance. I disliked the coyness with which the psychological condition of the narrator and the medical condition of his wife were not named and could see no reason for it. As the story unfolds it becomes obvious that there have been serious events in the past which would most certainly have impacted on the contemporaneous story, but which have apparently faded into oblivion. The complexity of the motives for behaviour are neglected and unexamined, giving it - for me, at least - much less of an impact than "Kevin", a book I may never recover from. </text></scrape>
