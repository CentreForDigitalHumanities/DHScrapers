I have been listening to the narrator for hours now and having finally arrived at the main course, I still have no idea whatsoever why these people are meeting and what terrible situation they need to discuss. I can fill you in on lots of other goings on but I wouldn't want to put you to sleep discussing the men's room wall or Scarlett Johansson. When I would prefer to fold laundry in silence...this is an indication that it is time to choose a new audio book. I honestly cannot imagine reading this book. The narrators charming voice and the hope of something actually happening at some point combined to keep me listening...but now I'm moving on. Not for me. 1.5 stars.</text></scrape>
