It's very well-written, and the characters are fascinating in their way, but I just didn't like them and found their decisions disturbing on a moral level. The author hooked me with the dynamic between the two brothers, and by the time the main course was served I knew I would keep reading to find out what happened, but it was very much in the manner of one who sees something awful and just can't turn away. </text></scrape>
