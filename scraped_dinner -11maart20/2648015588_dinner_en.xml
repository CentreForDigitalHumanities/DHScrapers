Hubbard</author><rating>it was ok</rating><text>How did I hate this book? Let me count the ways! This was my book club choice, and I had been looking forward to reading it because of the many positive reviews. I knew it was dark and that the characters were unlikeable, but that never bothers me as long as they're unlikeable in an interesting way. The problem for me is that this is a "high concept" book whose concept turns out to be preposterous in many ways. The book description says only that two couples are having dinner at a restaurant and the evening runs off the rails as they start exploring troubling events. Okay, that makes sense. What doesn't make sense is that the dinner was planned from the outset for the two couples to discuss their problem. Now why would you plan a dinner in a fancy, hip restaurant if you knew you'd be discussing something scandalous? And one of the four is a famous politician that everyone recognizes! So, right you're going to go into the limelight tackle a problem that's guaranteed to cause a big scene. Next, the treatment of mental illness is positively insulting. And the medical "twist" at the end smacks of science fiction in a book that, up until this point, was totally realistic. I only finished it so I could discuss it at our book club meeting. </text></scrape>
