As I'm sure most of you are keeping score at home, you'll remember my last review of Turning Angel by Greg Iles. In it I complained of it becoming over-plotted towards the end. While reading The Dinner, it struck me just what it was that bugged me about that, and it is this: there is a glaring difference between plot and story. This is what I was enjoying about The Dinner. The way the structure was, centering on four people having dinner together and backfilling what had brought them there, it made me realize that this was not so much as a plot, but a story forming of these people. You know what I mean? And that is what I love so much in a good novel: the story of characters which is usually driven by character development and the situations they are put up against.That's the easy part of this review.The hard part? That's saying I didn't like it because of these characters. And I can't believe I'm saying this because I've always loved books with well developed characters no matter how despicable they may be.These are despicable, self-centered, uncompassionate characters. Maybe my problem lies with the fact that perhaps they weren't well enough developed so I could at least understand them more and why they think the way they do (although this is explained for a couple of them). Usually this wins me over, but man, some of this was hard to get around. I can't go into more without spoiling things so that's all I have to say about it.Structure wise this novel gets highest marks, and I blew through it. But I can't ignore the fact that I was so happy to finish it last night and put these assholes away for good. Typically I'd five-star a book that gets under my skin like this one did but something inside me just won't let me do it. So I'm cutting that in half: 2.5 stars, and the dirty feeling is just starting to wear off.</text></scrape>
