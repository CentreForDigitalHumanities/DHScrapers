The Dinner is neither of those things, nor written in a compelling enough fashion to make up for its flaws. Too predictable to be a thriller, too hypocritically fascinated with its sociopathic characters to be read as an indictment against them, and the entire trope of the eponymous dinner as a narrative frame was gimmicky and unnecessary.</text></scrape>
