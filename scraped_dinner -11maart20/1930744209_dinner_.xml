The "horrible crime" is not mentioned too much, and I understand that the point was to focus on the dysfunctional, essentially psychopathic family. I'm a big fan of dislikable characters, but here, Paul was just too whiny and I literally didn't care what happened to most of the characters. I was much more interested in Claire, and would have preferred to hear from her. Overall, I wish there was a bit more explanation regarding certain events, but the suspicious tone, mistrust, and conspiracy was interesting to ponder.</text></scrape>
