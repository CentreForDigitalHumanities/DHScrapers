I couldn't put this book down it took me less than a day in total to finish, and it did not finish the way I expected it to. A family dinner between two brothers and their wives in a posh restaurant in Holland. Set over the span of about 5 or 6 hours you learn more about this family than you may care to. Initially you are led to believe that they are there to talk about their kids, but it eventually becomes a battle royal and a show of just how far families are willing to go for one another. Even if it means hurting another member of the extended family. It brings up the time old debate of nature vs. nurture, is blood thicker than water, and other questions. This book was suspenseful and will leave you appalled at what people are capable of all in the name of loving their family. </text></scrape>
