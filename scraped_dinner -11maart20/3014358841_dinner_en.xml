Love and hate relationship but overall really loved it. What would you do to protect your children? What if they done a crime? What would you do to protect your image? Not sure which character is the worst one, cause there are no good ones, only villains. Touched quite a lot social problems including rasism, class differences in society and how we see them. A lot of details. I want to go to that restaurant they have been! Donâ€™t expect nice touchy read, it will fuck with your mind and ruin all the hopes that people are good in general </text></scrape>
