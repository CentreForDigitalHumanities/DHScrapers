For a book like this to work and for the pay-off to succeed, it has to be extremely well and carefully set up. I found the premise of this book highly implausible and the characters flat and unbelievable. There are other authors who excel in this technique whereby an initial horrific event leads to series of reactions that, while improbable, seem like the only natural outcome of the characters' situation. (Ian McEwan and The Cement Garden come to mind.) I found myself rolling my eyes too many times at the absurdity of the plot and the childishness of the adult characters. Sorry.</text></scrape>
