While meticulously plotted, I cannot see myself wanting to reread a book where even the most sympathetic and maternal character, Claire, turns out to be morally reprehensible. Perhaps this is a clever exposition on the greyness of morality when it comes to family, but I refuse to believe that so many bad deeds can go unpunished.</text></scrape>
