Did just read this correctly? Despicable psychopathic parents who are encouraging their teenage son to not only cover up a murder he committed, but also encouraging him to kill his cousin , who was a witness and wants to expose him? As it is, I was wondering when the heck things would start happening...took about 80 pages in to find out what was going on..before then, was just a bunch of dinner conversation. Oh, and Paul, actually apologizing to his son for going through his phone??? what the hell? excuse me but shouldn't you be talking about how your son likes to beat up homeless people and film it, and ended up killing one person instead of being worried about his privacy? And Claire was just as bad...oh, I know you murdered someone honey, but let's keep this from your father, and oh by the way, while we're out to dinner why don't you "take care" of your cousin who wants to expose your crime. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE people. I was disgusted. I did however, give the book two stars instead of one because of the anger and disgust the book brought out in me...the book must have some merit after all if it can invoke such emotions in its readers. </text></scrape>
