As drawn out as a dinner in a fine french restaurant (yes, I used that analogy intentionally). This story was slowly presented with build-up that was far too spaced apart by the too many side and back stories such that the main story, occurring in the course of maybe four hours, was so lost in the telling it became frustrating. The narrator's performance elevated this book from a one-star rating to a two-star rating. Had I spent my time with the book in print(which I do own and purchased with the intention of reading until I saw that the audio version was available for check out from my library's overdrive holdings), I am certain I wouldn't have made it past the 1/3 mark. Interestingly, this was at exactly the moment in this story in which the author/main character remarks on a reader not wanting to quit a book half way into it after investing the time to read the first half of a book.I would only cautiously recommend this book to others.UPDATE: Not better the second time 'round. This time, I'm reading for book club. I have fingers crossed that the discussion will make the time spent on this book worthwhile.</text></scrape>
