The narration is simple and boring. The narrator tells us in excruciating detail the specifics of the menu and his ordering. I cringed as he ridiculed the waiter. He also sounds like a pompous ass as he talks about the ‘normal’ café where ‘normal’ people congregate. I felt like I was force feeding myself the first half of this book. Will the narrator ever get to the point? Although the story ostensibly takes place over a dinner, the narration jumps back and forth through various happenings in the past. He omits simple details like the disease from which his wife suffered and his medical condition. As he’s an obviously unreliable narrator, the reader is unsure of which events are fact and which are fiction. Frankly, I didn’t care enough about the narrator to try and figure it out. There was not one character in this novel who redeemed himself. They are all horrible people covering up a heinous crime committed by their children. I believe the stir this novel has caused is due to this subject matter. The question should arise as to how far you would go to protect your children. This issue, however, is irrelevant here as the severity of the crime committed by the children is such that a decent human being can only that they would not cover up the crime as these parents did. Lost in translation? As we discussed this novel at my book club, I realized all three of the Dutch members read the novel in Dutch and were decidedly more positive about the novel. They found the writing caustically witty. I have long been a believer that humor does not translate well. Being witty is especially difficult in a foreign language. Maybe someday I’ll have the time to read the novel in Dutch and make a different assessment. For now, I simply cannot recommend reading The Dinner. </text></scrape>
