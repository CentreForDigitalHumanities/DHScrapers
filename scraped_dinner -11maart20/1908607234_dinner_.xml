One of them is a famous politician, the next prime minister of the Netherlands. The story is told by Paul, the other brother. Paul is very interesting, he is a bit envy of his brother, he is very critical, and he is drifting in telling the story, from the dinner, and the menu, and the prices, and wine, to the people that want his brother autograph. Here is some of getting to know him, he is patronized all over the place:  What I was in fact planning to do was look at the prices of the entrées: the prices in restaurants like this always fascinate me. Let me make it clear right away that I’m not stingy by nature; that has nothing to do with it. I’m also not going to claim that money is no object, but I’m light-years removed from people who say it’s a “waste of money” to eat in a restaurant while “at home you can make things that are so much nicer.” No, people like that don’t understand anything, not about food and not about restaurants.But pretty quickly we find out that there is much more behind the scenes, there are their kids. Boys in the same age. And the adopted African boy. And we see more of Paul's inner state of not liking his brother much, criticizing and finding a motive for everything that he does: Serge Lohman, the politician with the adopted African son.He began to pose more frequently for family photographs. It looked good, Serge and Babette on the couch with the three children at their feet. Beau Lohman became living proof that there was one politician who didn’t act purely out of self-interest—that he, at least at one point in his life, had not acted out of self-interest.And then, bringing past events, and current background event, we get more of the horrific things that are hidden, that need to be resolved. We learn more about the boys, about Paul, about the family. I would claim that I would cut out some of these, because it was a bit over the top (and would get 5 stars, if he would omit one or two of these incidents that were taking it to too much). It all sneaks on the reader, from a quite amusing dinner with a too-critical enjoy-to-complain and not-happy-with-anything funny guy, to a I really don't want to meet this guy, ever!The way the story developed reminded me of the outstanding The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, telling a mild story, slow pace, talking about cleaning silver, and then exposing revolutionary stuff, terrible things, in the same patient tone, as a side-comment, leaving the reader at awe, in a deep surprise, because it is the last thing we could expect.This book is really clever, and one of the most well written books that I have read lately. I cannot give less than 4 stars to such writing. and I would give it 5 stars, if Koch would drop one or two unnecessary events as I said. A great book, with not a single likable character.</text></scrape>
