It's a book that ultimately rests upon questions of morality, specifically the reader's reactions to the moral choices the characters make in the face of emotionally complex family circumstances. Everyone here is unlikeable--that's putting it lightly--but the real question is why and what for?In the second half of the book, as the moral consequences of the actions taken by the characters become clearer and clearer, the author gives these characters a genetic crutch that essentially robs them of their agency. When the characters are no longer making choices for themselves, but are instead simply victims of an unavoidable genetic defect, the whole premise of the book more or less falls apart. What's left is the story of a collection of sociopaths doing bad things to each other, and suffering very little for it, and there's really nothing interesting for the reader to take away from that.</text></scrape>
