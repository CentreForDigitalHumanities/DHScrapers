The author did a great job in creating an unlikable, pretentious and envious first-person narrator. It is interesting to see, how he impacts his family and how the people respond to his behavior. We also have a mystery, some social criticism, satirical elements, some very sad moments and a lot of thoughts concerning the relationship between parents and children. For such a short novel it contains a lot and it did a good job connecting all theses things. </text></scrape>
