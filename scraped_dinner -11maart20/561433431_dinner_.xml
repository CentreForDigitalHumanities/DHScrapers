Bourgeois Dutch parents (the narrator, his more successful politician brother, their wives) meet over dinner in a fancy restaurant to figure out how to fix a mess caused by their delinquent teenage sons. I think the author's intent is to shock us by (i) the heinous nature of the boys' offence and (ii) the lengths to which the parents will go to protect them, both of which slowly become clear as the evening wears on. But it wasn't all that shocking, really. The story is skillfully constructed, though, with particularly adept use of the old "unreliable narrator" trope.To be fair, I read this immediately after finishing "Gone Girl", so it was bound to suffer in comparison.</text></scrape>
