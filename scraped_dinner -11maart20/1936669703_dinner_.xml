I really wanted to love it but ended up disappointed, mainly because I believed it to be a chilling, psychological thriller, which it was not. Not even close. Apparently, it's also satire! Who knew. Not me. I did feel the descriptions of the food and prices were very reminiscent of American Psycho though. The first half of the book is pretty boring with just a hint here and there of what's to come. It does pick up about halfway, but I think the book overall really lacks suspense think it needed. It just seemed like a lot of it was not believable and too many unanswered questions for my taste. I did enjoy the writing though. Maybe if there'd been just a bit more tension and explanations I would have enjoyed it more. Plus it is a translation, so maybe something was lost in that. </text></scrape>
