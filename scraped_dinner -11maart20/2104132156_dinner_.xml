As far as the plot goes, it's nothing alike, however, it IS a dark plot, with basically no likable characters. So I guess there's that similarity. That being said, I do think the book brought up a few interesting questions: how far would you go to protect your family, and how far is ethical? To what extent should children be held accountable for their actions? Etc. In the situation of The Dinner, I felt like there were obvious answers to these questions, and I hated all the characters for not seeing that. However, it did get me thinking about my own life, my own family, and what I would do for them. In summary, I hated everything that happened in this book, and I hated all the characters (Serge somewhat excluded). BUT I enjoyed the moral questions it posed, so two stars for that.EDIT: After thought, I'm taking it to one star. Unlikable characters, and a cruel premise don't really justify more than one star. On a personal note, my father is homeless, and that aspect of the book made me somewhere in between sick to my stomach, and absolutely furious. I get what the author was trying to do, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.</text></scrape>
