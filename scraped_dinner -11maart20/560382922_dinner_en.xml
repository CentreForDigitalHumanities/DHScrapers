I'd say they zeroed in on the wrong elements of Gone Girl, a classic readers advisory mistake. First I should be asked, what did I like about Gone Girl? Well it wasn't the characters, they were horrid (that's true in The Dinner too). It was more about the suspense, the pacing, how I couldn't wait to find out what happened. In The Dinner, the author tells you halfway through dinner and then goes in circles to tell the rest of the story. I was so tired of the characters and the original event (which wasn't nearly as bad as expected given the buildup) that I was begging for the check (har har). I don't even wonder (view spoiler)[about this family full of what seems to be psychopaths and how they can sit there and drink wine and not snap sooner than they do.  (hide spoiler)]This review in the New York Times gets at some of how I feel - how outside of America, people don't expect characters to be likeable but this may not be to American tastes. I think that's a bit reductive. I don't expect my characters to be likeable but I don't like my time wasted, and I felt like it was a bit, even in this short book. It kind of begs the question, really, if you have a suspenseful event, why write a novel and tell the story through a sit-down dinner? It's like you've traded in everything exciting for long descriptions of French cheese and blackberry sorbet. The mundane details take too much of a focus and the interesting parts get lost. I'd rather read about Nicholson Baker's thoughts while riding an escalator, which somehow go much deeper than this.</text></scrape>
