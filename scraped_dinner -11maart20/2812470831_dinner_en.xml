The flashbacks were interesting as well as the lengths some people would go to just to hide something. I had a hard time getting into this book and it started off extremely slow for me. I had to push to get thru the book and it did get more interesting. I think I may have enjoyed it more had I been feeling better. I was honestly just not feeling it so I may re-read down the line.</text></scrape>
