It gripped me from the start, listening to this narrator who was funny and cynical, who can’t stand his wealthy a**hole famous brother, who puts up with defects in others in a humorous barbed way.	Then, halfway through the book, you realize you’ve been duped, nothing is at it seems, and the story turns from literary fiction with a humorous, perhaps satirical bent, into something resembling pure horror.	It’s hard to talk about this book without giving away the twists and turns and creepy plot points that the author skillfully lets slip bit by bit until you’ve finally put together a picture. I’ll just say that the narrator’s decidedly non-politically-correct voice is pitch perfect. Though, it is his wife who mostly speaks for him (an unnerving realization when it hits you, when you finally understand the unusual admiration they have for each other).	I’ve said, and it’s been widely touted as a book that takes place entirely during the course of a dinner in an uppity restaurant, but that’s not at all accurate. I would guess at least half the book is told in flashbacks that take place in schools and hospitals while investigating cell phones and youtube videos and the like and its these flashbacks where the guts of the entire story lie. 	Sadly, I feel I’ve given away too much already. I’ll close by saying the book is deeply disturbing, that it baits you and hooks you and before you know it, you feel you are an accomplice to a crime, that you are guilty of sympathizing too well, and by the time you realize you have befriended the wrong people, well… it’s too late. </text></scrape>
