This one was extremely contrived from the outset and the characters were all horrible. I know you can say that about Summer House... as well, but that one was compelling and entertaining, and I found it hard to put down. This one I had to really slog through. The narrator was utterly despicable as well as unreliable, and none of the other characters were any better. I also really didn't care what they had done or what happened to them. </text></scrape>
