It wasn't that thrilling, but the build up was. There was a lot Koch could have done with this - the bare bones were certainly there, but he didn't seem to want to take advantage of any of them. For example, there is an allusion to Paul having some kind of mental disorder - schizophrenia perhaps - that he passed onto his son, so I was expecting that to serve as some sort of plot twist....it doesn't. Claire, we discover, had some kind of debilitating illness when Michel was about five, but that is *also* never used as anything other than a way to display Paul's anger (like it isn't showcased in like seven other independent chapters already...). It seemed like we learned more about the Lohman brothers relationship and Serge's political career than we did anything else...I say skip this and read "We Need To Talk About Kevin" instead. Two stars because it was a good read, like a donut - tasty but ultimately bad for you and unfulfilling. </text></scrape>
