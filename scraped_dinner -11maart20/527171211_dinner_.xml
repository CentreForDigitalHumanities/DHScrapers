It was unevenly paced and unnecessarily detailed in certain areas. I HATED every last psycho character and couldn't take anymore of the whining sociopathic narrator! And what's up with the secrecy regarding the wife's illness, Paul's disorder, hospital name, school name etc?? Also, who goes to discuss such a private matter in public?? Going to bat for your kid is one thing but covering up a despicable crime, basically encouraging and ensuring that there will be future despicable crimes is just plain horrendous. I'll give it 2 stars because it didn't take forever to read. Ugh</text></scrape>
