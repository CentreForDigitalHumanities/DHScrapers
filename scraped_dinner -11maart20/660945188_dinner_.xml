Definitely not the pace of Gone Girl- I don't think you can compare the two. Whereas Gone Girl was actively entertaining, this book is much more of a character analysis. Slowly, the nature of the characters reveal themselves. It was entertaining, but I personally have one too many characters in my life with repressed emotions to have the capacity or patience to appreciate the disturbing personality of the protagonist. Nor did I have any patience for the crimes committed. I found myself questioning what kind of parents behave like this and ultimately applauded the character you're set up not to like... Would make a good discussion book. </text></scrape>
