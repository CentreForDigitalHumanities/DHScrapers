I tried, but I only got through half because it never grabbed me. I picked it up because Gillian Flynn recommended it, so I thought I'd like it. That wasn't the case.Sure, the concept of a cell phone video capturing such a vile crime could have potential, especially with social media in the 21st century. Plus, there is the angle of a volatile politician linked to said crime. But the characters were bland. I felt distracted. And I was mostly bored. Sorry, Herman Koch. Maybe another time.</text></scrape>
