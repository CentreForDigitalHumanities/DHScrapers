Is that the point? Frankly I didn't care.Some books are based on plot, some on character -- this book seems to be based on mind and memory. For chapters at a time it goes off into reminiscing and recalling past events, leaving the dinner behind. Maybe it's because it wasn't well done or entertaining enough, but it felt like cheating when the author ran off with different past scenes and left the dinner behind for dozens of pages altogether.Anyway, I wasn't really into this one. What's the deal with all these creepy Dutch stories about crummy characters?</text></scrape>
