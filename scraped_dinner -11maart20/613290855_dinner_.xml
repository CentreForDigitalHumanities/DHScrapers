What I CAN say is this book has been translated beautifully into English. I didnt feel for one second that I was missing anything that may have been lost in translation. So many thought provoking questions linger from this novel. How far would you go to protect your child? How important is social standing to some people? What defines mental illness as opposed eccentricity? How far should we go in medicating mental illness? All of these questions and more along with the complexities of the family relationship make this an unforgettable read.</text></scrape>
