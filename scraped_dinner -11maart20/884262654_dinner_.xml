From the blurb I knew that there was a crime committed somewhere so it fell nicely in the genre I love reading. Then there was the Dutch author whose name sounded German (completely due to my lack of knowledge of Dutch names) - He could be my first Dutch crime writer. Consequently, I picked it out of hundreds on my bookshelves and started turning the pages.Once I started, I found it difficult to put down. So a couple of very late nights later, I reached its bitter end, the ending which I know quite a few readers on GoodReads complained about, deeply disturbing, yet somehow realistic.As a norm, I do not read any reviews before I begin my book of choice, but I do scan through a few after I finished consuming, especially if I am prepared to write a review for it. I wanted to know what my fellow readers think of the book, and if they confirm my thoughts or otherwise. The Dinner scooped thousands of reviews on GoodReads. I read only a couple, a positive 5-star with praises and a one-star which panned it. I liked them both. I assume that most critical reviews stem from the unlikeable characters, especially the narrator. Personally, I don’t like any of them either, detesting some of them with a passion. I remember that when Claire was arguing with her brother-in-law in defending her son’s actions, I wanted to jump into the page, telling her that she sounded ridiculous and willing her to shut up! In Mark’s (GoodReads Reader) words, the characters in this book have “no sense of personal responsibility, no remorse, no soul searching”. I share my utter contempt towards them - they are sadly lacking in what typify many of the respectable values of white, middle class people in the West. However, I am giving it 4 stars - I even considered a higher rating, had any of the characters displayed more redeeming characteristics. The stars go to the writer of this book Herman Koch, who, in my view, has written a great book. There were very funny moments in the early part of the book, which made me laugh. The writing style is very engaging, and it has kept my interest from the very beginning. Little by little, we get to learn more about the characters and what happened before the fateful dinner. If you don’t mind reading a story with despicable main characters and the associated actions, and getting into their psych and dysfunctional minds, you would enjoy this book. I loved this book, for its beauty of language (I read in English and I am greatly impressed, so a marvellous job for the translator, I must add), the setting (both the dinner and the posh restaurant served as a prolonged suspense, filled the readers with an eager anticipation), the characterisation (even though you may hate them), and the pace (slow to start with, but gathering pace and reaching the climax, or perhaps an anti-climax towards the end).
