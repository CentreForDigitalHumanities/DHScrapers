I have mixed feelings with this book.First off, it was written well, in the case of plot points and cliffhangers. I did like the narrative of the main character and how it told stories of the courses of the meal and the history of the family (interwoven). The style of writing was very similar to how Alex wrote The Silent Patient. A few sore points (spoilers):The entire family is essentially shielding a murderous and dangerous person. There's so much wrong with the way the family treats the deranged son's actions. It's clear the father has anger management issues, which are clearly untreated. I did like the inner monologue about the father with regards to the anger management, but would have thought he would have more of a conscience to hold back on his actions. On paper, this was a good book, but if you can imagine this being a real-life family, the news would rip everyone a new one. And yeah, I saw this pop up a few times in the reviews, and I second it:NO ONE. NOOO ONE would hold a meeting THIS critical and important AND PRIVATE in such a bougie high-faluting restaurant. The book should have been called "The Locked Door Discussion" because that's where they should have held this meeting. It kinda reminded me of one of the seasons of the show 24 where the son or daughter was putting on a big show whether the father was like - the president. Anyways....2.8/5</text></scrape>
