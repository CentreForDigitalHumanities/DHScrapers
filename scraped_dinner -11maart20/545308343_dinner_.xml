It's a quick read, with, believe it or not, some funny bits. (The narrator's misplaced reticience and delicate sensibilities about what he does and does not reveal are a hoot.)Book clubs might want to chew on the nature vs. nurture implications. I wish the author had grounded a particular plot point about amniocentesis with more actual peer-reviewed science. </text></scrape>
