The premise is interesting enough -- how far would you go, as a parent, to protect your child if you knew he/she had committed a terrible crime? In that sense, the book reminded me a bit of Defending Jacob. In the latter story, I was frustrated with the parents for being so consistently naive. In this book, I was frustrated with the parents for being so completely immoral and unlikeable.The layout was unique. It is set up almost like a play, except it is organized into dinner courses, from appetizers to dessert, instead of acts. In this way, it is very well-paced. The thing is, I kept wondering to myself, why would anyone go to a fancy restaurant (i.e., a public place) to discuss whether or not to turn in your children for a heinous crime? I mean, if they don't want anyone to know, discussing it in a public location probably isn't such a good idea.The other issue I had was the undisclosed mental illness of the father. We are to suppose that the son inherited this illness, and that it may have been detected early on in the womb through amniocentesis. I'm not up on the science here, but if we are to presume the father and son had a form of psychopathy or impulsive behavior disorder, I don't think that's something that can be detected in the womb. I'm not even sure that can be detected by any standard medical test as an adult; it's more of a checklist of personality characteristics and behavior. So, that part of the story seemed rather flawed to me.In any event, the writing is quite good and I thought there was a lot of potential here, but I just had too many issues with it to say I really enjoyed it. A mild 3 stars.</text></scrape>
