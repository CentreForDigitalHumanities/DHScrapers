I guess I understand that from the perspective of there being no sympathetic protagonists, but the comparison really ends there. This book has much more in common with "We need to talk about Kevin.""The Dinner" does a great job of lulling the reader into a false sense of what is going on. Paul Lohman makes snarky observations and takes the reader into his confidence like two friends talking crap about the sad state of affairs in the modern world.But then, the truth of his situation is slowly fleshed out and what is really going on is highly disturbing.Your enjoyment of this book will depend entirely upon whether or not you can enjoy something that is extremely well written, engrossing, but without a single redeemable character. I can, but I'd understand if someone couldn't.</text></scrape>
