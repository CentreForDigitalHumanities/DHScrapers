I could chew on the structure and narration of this novel for a long time without eking out all the flavors available to the attentive reader. I love the richness of the satire and the first-person narrator who is lacking in all self-awareness and any and likable traits. YET, over half-way through the dinner, the narrator reveals he has a German-named neurological disorder that the reader is left to intelligently assume is Asperger's (yet, it feels more like sociopathy and doesn't really work). And the novel veers from a political satire with commentary on the modern, upper-middle class family to a treatise on nature versus nurture. This felt contrived and pretentious. It just didn't need to happen--like they put ketchup on my steak. Yep. That's it. This dinner was really good until they put ketchup on the steak. Bummer.</text></scrape>
