For the first few chapters, this book had a lot of promise: witty observations of an cynical narrator, a rivalry between brothers, tension between their children, an unspoken incident, a forced dinner party. It then takes a nosedive around chapter 26. The dialogue becomes ridiculous, as do the actions and motivations of the characters. And the dinner party aspect gets put on the back burner through a series of unnecessary flashbacks. I didn't care about any of the characters, even the one that seems the most level-headed. There's a semi-explanation for some of what occurs, but it's both silly and boring. I feel frustrated because this book could have been better than it is. Maybe it got cleaned up in the screenplay? </text></scrape>
