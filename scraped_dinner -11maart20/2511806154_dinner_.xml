So, I did. And now we can discuss our shared dislike for The Dinner.I will allow that I know I am not supposed to like these characters, and the plot is supposed to display a slowly revealed transition from sheer pretentiousness to outright depravity from the whole lot of them. In that way, this novel succeeds. However, despite the long reveal, I didn't feel that this was anything that could be classified for me as a Thriller or a Suspense novel. I was in no way riveted or anxious about the plot. I was disgusted with these people, for sure, and I was irritated and annoyed at the tone and approach and delivery of the plot...but it honestly never even occurred to me that this was a suspenseful story.Between the forceful and demanding tone of the narrator, and the dips into second person point-of-view, it was all like listening to that person with whom you don’t want to talk and whom you don’t like, but who will force his grievances or life story on you anyway. I hate when I can’t tell whether the pretentiousness that oozes from a character is because of the characterization or because it comes from the author, but I feel that maybe it's a case of both here.In some ways, this reminded me of a less elegant and cheaper Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by establishing a dinner or evening with a foursome that is slowly spiraling out of control based on something that is to be revealed through the course of the night. But the reveal is much different and the characters are so incredibly not relatable that it borders on being wholly unbelievable.</text></scrape>
