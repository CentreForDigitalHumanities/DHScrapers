It is too easy to spoil, but two couples meet for dinner to discuss a mutual problem. Slowly, over the course of the evening, the problem is revealed as well as their less than morally acceptable solution. This is not my usual fare, but it is well-written and it goes quickly. It was originally published in Holland and translated and has been discussed in many media outlets. I heard the author on the NPR Books podcast which cemented it for me, but it may not be for everyone.</text></scrape>
