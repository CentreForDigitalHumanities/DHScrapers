If I had read a physical copy of the book I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as much. This is a book you have to go into blind because not much can be said without giving anything away. These are my thoughts: (view spoiler)[The concept was interesting, and I love books that don't have happy endings (though I guess this one kind of did from Paul's prospective) because life doesn't always work that way. It's hard to read a story that has no silver lining. It's one thing to read a book in a series where a character gets away with bad behavior, but to read a standalone book where there is no moral resolution is frustrating and a little scary. Will Michel and his cousin kill someone else? Will Paul and Michel get the help that they need? What will happen to Serge and Babbette? Will they eventually turn on Paul and Claire? There is no justice in this book and the bad guys are left to roam free. Again, it's an interesting concept, but the book was too slow paced for my liking and I found myself feeling bored most of the time.(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]</text></scrape>
