And the harassment/assault of other homeless people (one is explicit, others are implied). And the narrator and his wife are awful horrible loathsome people who think that this whole thing should just be covered up so that their son doesn't suffer for it. There were literally times where I yelled "What the fuck is wrong with you people??" and scared the cats. I hated the narrator and his wife. I know the setup is that the brother and his wife are the terrible people, but at least the brother wants to reveal the crime. As you read, it becomes obvious that the father has some disorder that makes him violent, and that he has passed this on to his son. Many things are not delved into, with the narrator saying that it's private, or none of our business to know. This is to let us as readers draw our own conclusions, and I certainly drew mine, right down the "fucking psychos" line. It's left up in the air at the end, but I'm pretty sure the sons kill the adopted son of the brother at the end. Again, conclusion drawn from the psycopathic actions of the characters throughout the book. I'm not regretting I read this, as good books often cause serious emotion, but I just can't rate it highly, because it made me *too* angry for me to really enjoy anything about it. Well-written and suspenseful, but just not my cup of tea. And I'm going to miss the bookclub where we talk about it, which I am already regretting. I'm sure it'll be a great discussion.</text></scrape>
