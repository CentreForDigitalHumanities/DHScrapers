I wish I could say it lived up to my expectations. This is about two brothers and their wives and a problem that arises with their kids. However the primary issue of the book does not come up until almost halfway through the book. The first 125 pages or so just felt to me like a story about a man who does not like his politician brother. Even when the problem that the two sets of parents have to figure out how to deal with, which is the reason they are having dinner, arises it still seems to take a backseat to the past of the brother telling the story and the disdain he has for his brother. This had the potential to be a great story, but really fell short for me. </text></scrape>
