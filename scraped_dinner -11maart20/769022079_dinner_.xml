I simply read it because it was my book club's selection. Honestly, I felt physically ill while reading most of it. The amount of evil and sick behavior exemplified in this book is beyond normal comprehension. There is no complexity or meaning to it, it's simply awful for the sake of being awful. I also failed to see the humor in it that many of the reviews had mentioned. The only reason I even finished it was in hopes that it would all conclude in some way as to give the hellaciousness of the past pages some kind of greater purpose, which did not happen.</text></scrape>
