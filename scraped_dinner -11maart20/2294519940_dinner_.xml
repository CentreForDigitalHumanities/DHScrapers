I squirmed with how unlikeable they were. The restaurant scenes were so brilliantly compelling I was impatient when we left them for backstory, just as one can get impatient when service of the next course is a bit too slow coming. But the backstory of the sons’ crime was soon irresistibly compelling too, in a similar squirm-worthy way. I soon forget most books I read no matter how much I’ve loved them. This one may stick with me a while.</text></scrape>
