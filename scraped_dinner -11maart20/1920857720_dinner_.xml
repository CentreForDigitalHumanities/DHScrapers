Though it’s doesn’t slap you from the first sentence like Summer House With Swimming Pool, it’s main twist in the middle knocks you for a loop.No spoilers here, but let’s just say that Mr. Koch finds a way to be as thrilling as Gillian Flynn, without her irresistible premises. That's not a backhanded compliment - it's a compliment. This book is about a couple having dinner, and you can't put it down.Regardless, this book invites you to the table, serves you a bottle of wine, and then leaves you breathless just as the appetizers are coming in.</text></scrape>
