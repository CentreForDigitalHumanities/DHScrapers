I found it not so bad as I had before, but still not much. Characters were neither likable nor particularly clever, making one bad decision after another. Nor did they relate to each other in any meaningful way.moved from 1* to 2**.comments Aug 2014 ... I am now 23% through and will go no further. If anything interesting happens, I will not read about it. This is the most pathetic bit of nothing I have read in a long time. One meaningless bit of drivel after another. I can't imagine why it has been so popular. Now I'll go read the other GR reviews and find out what others thought.Well, most of you just loved this book. Maybe it's me. My wife just reminded me it's on our book club list for next year, so I guess I'll have to go back to it sometime. Just not sometime soon. I'll post again when I read the rest.</text></scrape>
