It is from a Dutch author and therefore it is difficult to review its translation rather then the original, but alas, I do not speak Dutch. This book is essentially about two couples coming together at a restaurant to discuss a disturbing act that their children did. The men are brothers and their history, failures and successes frame their discussion. Magnified more because one brother will likely be the next Prime Minister of the Netherlands, while the other has just been fired from his secondary school teaching position. Aside from this basic plot, which is profound and disturbing, there is a subplot that looks into the nature vs. nurture debate. The future PM's son is adopted from Burkina Faso; his brother's, our narrator, son is not adopted. They both committed the same violent act, but each reacts very differently after the act. Similarly, the fathers, the brothers, have diverging views of what should be done. Their story has become fodder for the national press not only because of the violent nature, but also because it was caught on security camera, but the perpetrators have not been identified, yet. What makes this novel interesting to me is that none of the characters, save the hostess at the restaurant, are decent people. The future PM, obviously, must have charisma or we people would not vote for him, but each person's flaws are magnified. Which brings us to the narrator...I have a deep love of flawed narrators, which probably says more about how I view myself than any particular author's writing. This author is terribly flawed and so it is difficult to discern what is true about himself and the other participants. We must not immediately believe what he tells us. This causes us to lean in a bit closer as he eavesdrop on their conversation. It also forces us to dive into the psychology of each character... and our own. Perhaps this is why many have given this book such a poor review. It is not an easy book to read because in order to consume it one must be willing to look at oneself. We are also forced to look at our society and culture. I think this is why I tend to enjoy books that are considered foreign to folks that live in the states. I look forward to watching the several movies that are based on this book.</text></scrape>
