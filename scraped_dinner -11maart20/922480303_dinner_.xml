Not that I can read Dutch, but you know, sometimes when you get a book translated into English, it's stilted and painful to read. Not so with The Dinner. It was very smooth writing and for all I knew could have been written in English first. (At least for all I knew until I read the background on the novel.) That said, I don't know why everyone is making such a fuss over this book. It's not that great. In fact, I really came to hate all of the characters by the time 292 pages were up. I thought the main character was totally insane and ridiculous. And everyone else was just slightly insane. I thought maybe the author was setting up the characters the way he did to make a point, but if he was, then the point fell flat at the end because it never went anywhere. It was just... meh. </text></scrape>
