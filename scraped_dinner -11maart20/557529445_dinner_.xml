Then again, it could just be that I really hated this book. The writing is horribly stilted (which, as I said, could be a translation thing) and unrealistic. I didn't identify with any of the characters, in fact they just made me angry and hate them all by the end. I mostly stayed with the book to find out what the children (Michel and Rick, who are cousins) did. Luckily, you find out fast enough. They killed a homeless woman, which was apparently ok because she was in the way of the ATM machine and she smelled. Seriously, the fact that she smelled in pointed out multiple times and used as an excuse. The parents apparently feel that this wasn't that bad because A) she was homeless and it will blow over and B) she smelled and was in the way (Seriously, that's what Claire, Michel's mom, uses as an excuse for keeping quiet). Serge, Rick's father, seems to want to see justice for the woman, but only because the murder would effect his campaign. His idea to help this is to step down from the campaign, which his wife Babette is against for unclear reasons, and turn the boys in. Michel doesn't appear to feel bad about what he did, but according to Serge and Babette, Rick is suffering (this is repeated multiple times). How is this resolved? Claire, Michel's mother, attacks Serge with a wine glass so he can't resign. Then there's the issue that Michel and Rick are being blackmailed by Rick's adopted brother Beau because the morons recorded themselves killing the homeless woman and accosting another homeless man and Beau found them (because, shocker, Michel emailed the videos to Rick) and posted them on YouTube. How is this resolved? Well, Michel and Rick kill Beau. Claire even provides an alibi for Michel. Seriously, what the hell? Once again, the parents know and seem to be ok with this. Then there's the narrator, Paul. He just annoyed me with his constant whining about how his brother is a boor and an oaf and constantly reminding the reader that Claire is his wife. Then later you find out he's basically a sociopath who beat the shit out of his son's principle and his own brother at one point. Then there are the useless details the author drones about. There's the food, which is described in minute detail, the bathroom and how a man was peeing and what his junk looked like. Yeah. There are also some little side stories that seem to have nothing to do with the plot at all. In the end, no one seems to feel any guilt or remorse and I just felt disgusted with the characters. </text></scrape>
