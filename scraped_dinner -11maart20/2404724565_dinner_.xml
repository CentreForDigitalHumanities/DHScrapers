Once you finally get past the initial 10 chapters consisting of nothing but the narrator complains about his brother you discover that all of the characters were deeply deranged and vapid. Zero real resolution is achieved and the story arc of the adopted child is extremely troubling. The treatment of his murder as a means of covering up the heinous act of the other two children in the family alludes on a very disturbing notion that adopted children are somehow less than important and in this case less than human. The books concludes with all of the characters being extremely satisfied that they have had no consequences for their actions, except for Serge who suffered disfigurement for trying to do the right thing. The moral of this story being that is you are wealthy and powerful enough you should never have to pay for your actions and murdering those who get in your way is totally fine if they are poor, black, vagrant, or otherwise not of your same social class and ethnic background. This book is simultaneously dull, disturbing, and offensive. Honestly I think it is disgraceful that it is on so many must read lists.</text></scrape>
