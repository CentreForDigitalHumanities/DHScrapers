The structure fascinated me, the way in which the author unfolded the story was superb, but best of all was how he left us hanging in several plot points to ruminate about how things might have turned out. Plus, this book makes parents consider what they would do in a similar situation- I hope most would not go the route these couples did - but who knows. Awesome read!</text></scrape>
