PAGE 120! That's when I believe I finally found a reason to keep reading. I struggled through almost half the book because I found no meaning behind much of what the narrator was talking about. What really annoyed me most was the "Let me tell you a secret. Oh nevermind," attitude that he had throughout the entire book. If you are going to omit a detail of the story, don't even mention it sir. On a less bratty note, the novel inspired much debate about the balance between family loyalty and ethical responsibilities. In all honesty, I know what I would have liked to do in the situation from the outside looking in but the reality of what anyone would do in the situation is more foreign than I think. On another note, I would have loved to hear this story through each person's perspective. What a book that would be if they took a page out of Jodi Picoult's techniques and wrote the same situation from each character's perspective! In fact, I would probably read a sequel if it gave the story from Claire's perspective or even Serge's. I was left not trusting Mr. Lohman's character as much because he seemed like always the last to know. I was torn the whole time I read and yearning for another character's perspective to shine through. Overall, great last half -- interesting ending. If you make it past page 120... keep reading and dig deeper for a lasting meaning. </text></scrape>
