I was given this book for Christmas and once I picked it up, I found it hard to put down. The story is set in a restaurant in the Netherlands where 2 brothers and their wives are dining together. During the course of the evening, it is revealed that all is not as it seems in this family group. The 2 couples have sons the same age who are close friends who have become involved in a shameful crime but have not been caught. Each person at the table has their own opinions on what is to be done, and as the story plays out, we learn more about the personality of the adults. this is a horrifying tale of teenage brutality but is lightened by the wonderful satirical view of the pretentiousness of fine dining and politics. A great read. </text></scrape>
