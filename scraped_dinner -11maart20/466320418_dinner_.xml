That is what I said to Jackie (@Literary Hoarders) when I closed the book. It's now on its way over to her before it goes back to the library. On the back cover is a quote about how great this book is from the author of Gone Girl. Now Gone Girl was just ...you know...okay, for me. Nothing too shocking or surprising there really. But this one?! Wow. I can't even say much about it because it just gives too much away. Very powerful and I woke up this morning TOO EARLY because I was STILL thinking about the people in this book! </text></scrape>
