The edition I'm reading is not listed here on Goodreads yet. This book defines "unreliable narrator" and while it gets off to a slow start and you think, "Oh, another yuppie/bobo book where people eat fine meals", before too long, it pretty much knocks you over the head with disturbing images and plot. It was totally insidious the way this book worked on me. Not exceptionally written (or perhaps it was in the translation) but this book is dark and underhanded and very interesting. </text></scrape>
