Not a good advert for the Dutch psyche. Frequently felt like arguing out loud with Paul the very unreliable and distasteful narrator who appeared to condone acts of gratuitous violence. No sense of remorse or responsibility on behalf of any of the main characters. A nasty novel full of venom and racism. I gave it three stars because I thought it was well written, tightly plotted and thought provoking. Probably the depiction of the obsequious maitre de has put me off fine dining for life.</text></scrape>
