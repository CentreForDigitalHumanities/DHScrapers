Which is frustrating because so many people found it enthralling and brilliant. It makes me want to know what the heck I'm missing here. To me it was dull and flat. I didn't find the twist all that twisty. You knew from the way it was set up that there was going to have to be some bizarre turn of plot. Otherwise we're just reading about four boring and self-involved people eating dinner at a restaurant. For me it was kind of weird and droning. 2 stars?</text></scrape>
