I read it in one afternoon while on a cruise ship. The way the author wrote the story was interesting as he slowly dropped little hints and facts as the book went on. The narrator of the story reveals that he and his wife are meeting another couple for dinner one evening. As the dinner progresses, they talk about unimportant things instead of discussing a serious issue involving each of their sons. The reader finally learns what is wrong. However, I didn't understand the result or how they planned to solve the problem. It appears to me that the author was clever in telling the story but not so good as resolving it.</text></scrape>
