You might not like the characters, or the plot that is part of the subjects writer don't write without facing disdain, but the story, the narration, the slowly unfolding of the unthinkable actions, thoughts and behaviours are a masterpiece.
I loved this book! A book is not always about identifying with the characters or the plot, is also about making you think. This book kept me hooked for 3 days. I almost couldn't breathe.</text></scrape>
