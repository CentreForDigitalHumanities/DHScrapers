Clever writing, interesting exposition and crazy character development. The writer expertly twists reader sympathies and expectations. I found it slightly frustrating how he left several things unsettled/unexplained. I'm also unclear about the narrator's storytelling purpose - at several points he seems to be recounting everything for someone, or something, but then we never find out what that might be. I kept expecting to find out we were reading an account from a trial, or that it would end in a big scandalous news event/story, but no.. So, why can't he reveal the name of the restaurant, or his wife's illness, or his own? Very strange. In many ways, I was reminded of another book I recently read, Defending Jacob, which was also a recount by a dad whose son was accused of a crime, partly as trial testimony. That book was quite flat in terms of character development, so this book definitely succeeded where that one failed. This book's structure was much more interesting too. It was definitely dark and a little outrageous, but satisfying at the same time. Fast-paced, too - I read it in a few days. Would definitely recommend!</text></scrape>
