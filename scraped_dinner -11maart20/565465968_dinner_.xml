I loved it because I couldn't put it down. It was that much of a page turner; I had to know what was going to happen. If I had had the time I would have read it in a day. The plot was original and suspenseful. And the narration was so intriguing that you wanted to know everything about all the characters. After I finished I have found myself still thinking about it. It's a book that will stick with you. I hated this book because it was incredibly disturbing and a moral mind binder. Even though I wanted to know everything about all the characters, there was not ONE redeemable person in the whole book. I recommend this book to anyone that likes a book that is going to make you think but it is not for the faint of heart. Not only is it disturbing, it is a moral mind binder that will leave you wondering what just happened. </text></scrape>
