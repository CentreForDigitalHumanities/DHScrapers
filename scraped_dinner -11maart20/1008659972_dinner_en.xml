This book fascinates me. Koch manipulates your emotions and thoughts so deftly that it mesmerizes me. You are completely at his mercy as he tells this story :)

As for the narrator, he was just as brilliant as promised. I can't imagine that there would be a more perfect narrator for this particular role.

It is such a pleasure to be toyed with so effectively.</text></scrape>
