  "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." ~ Tolstoy

  Inside my head, a door had opened. A crack. And through that crack, light was shining. Warm light. Behind the door was the room with the happy family.
I am currently residing under what meteorologists are charmingly referring to as a Heat Dome. It's not all bad as the combined heat and humidity makes outside chores like weeding impossible. All of a sudden, it's perfectly acceptable to do nothing but sit around and read. With this in mind, I began searching my shelves for a quick, utterly encompassing page-turner of a read, and settled on this one. And while most reviewers, and there have been thousands, seem to either love or loathe this one, most seem to agree that it's a pretty compelling read. The premise? Two brothers and their wives meet for dinner at a fancy restaurant for the express purpose of talking about a problem with their children. There's a lot of intrigue right off the bat. In addition to the overt sibling rivalry, one of the women has obviously been crying on the way to the restaurant, PLUS, it is alluded to that one or both teens in question have done something really, REALLY bad.Is it any wonder this took me just over a day to read?  I'm tempted to give four stars as the book delivered exactly what I was hoping for in terms of being an engrossing page-turner, BUT Koch's writing didn't truly win me over - yes, I know his narrator was supposed to be a smug bastard, but I got tired of the "I'm not going to tell you the name of the restaurant, or the name of my disease, or the name of my wife's disease, etc." After a while it seemed like just so much I-know-something-you-don't-know-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah!Kudos to the author, however, for opening up a whole nasty can o' worms, plopping it on an open flame, and letting it simmer. The questions raised by this book . . . GEEZ! First of all, my snarky question of "Given the severity of the 'problem' with the kids, why would you EVER choose to discuss this in a public place?" But, also, there are deep, dark, disturbing questions that I honestly NEVER wanted to ask myself, like . . . "What would you do if your child committed an unspeakable crime?" "Would you make excuses for his behavior? Cover it up? Urge him to confess?"And perhaps most disturbingly . . ."How far would you go to protect your child?"</text></scrape>
