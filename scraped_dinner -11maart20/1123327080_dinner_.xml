Then it was just good enough to hold my attention for a long time. Eventually it took a sharp downward turn as I grew fed up with the unreliability of the narrator and the details or behaviours that were just too unrealistic; I lost patience with the obvious manipulation of setting in order to set up suspenseful moments that I didn't find at all suspenseful; the lack of discipline around phrases like "I grinned" or "I felt the hairs going up on the back of my neck" or "I tried not to blink" which were overused to the point of becoming irritants. All of these things can work (unreliable narrators, unrealistic details, stock phrases, etc.) if handled properly but they all conspired to push this particular reader away.I kept reading because I wanted to see whether it was as predictable as I thought it was going to be.It was.I wanted to like it - especially when I realized that the narrator was meant to be unlikeable (which doesn't happen for quite some time - another reason I found the book to have been written dishonestly.)But it left a bad taste in my mouth.</text></scrape>
