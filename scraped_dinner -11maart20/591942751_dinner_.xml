In retrospect (a day has passed between me reading the book and writing this review), it seems even worse than I initially thought it was. So, the characters are all unlikable. Fine. They're even psychopaths, one and all. That's fine too. But it's reaching when the narrator says he beat the shit out of his son's principal and speaks nothing of any repercussions. Like, being put in an asylum or in jail. He's still available to dine leisurely at a top Dutch restaurant and comparing dick sizes in the men's room. His son is another psychopath, but one who has not the basic cunning of not filming himself. Then in a further move of utter boneheadedness, he mails those videos to his cousin. Why exactly wouldn't someone blackmail him? This is blamed on the genes of father and son, by the way, but it doesn't quite explain the craziness of the wife. Apparently it has something to do with motherly love. I guess. I've no issues with psychopaths. I wish there were some believable psychos. This is fiction, after all. On top of that, it's judgmental. It's narrator whines non-stop, which is supposedly excused because he's a psychopath. But it's still highly uncomfortable - the way he hates his fellow Dutch, for example. It also rubbed me the wrong way when the narrator plays coy. He won't say which restaurant it is, because he thinks the reader will come looking for him. Another stupidity is when he says he won't let the reader know the time the alibi was set up, because, as he says, there's an ongoing investigation. This despite the fact that he just mentioned that (view spoiler)[his son committed multiple murders (hide spoiler)]. I suppose there is an ongoing investigation for that. What a turkey. I have another book by Koch I'm supposed to read for review, and I'm dreading it already. 1 star. </text></scrape>
