I've seen it everywhere ... Recommended based on previous books I've read, top lists, friends shelves and I've stared at it on the shelf thinking I should read that. And now I have and I'm unimpressed. This book is dark and weird and does an awful lot of talking around deep scary subjects but never digging into the meat of them. Why was the mom in the hospital? What kind of parents encourage their kid to kill another kid? And laugh about it? Their willingness to overlook what happened with the homeless woman? Really??? I can understand the need to protect your child but this was something much deeper and darker than that. Almost a willingness to hide from it and pretend it never happened ... It's odd. The whole book was odd. </text></scrape>
