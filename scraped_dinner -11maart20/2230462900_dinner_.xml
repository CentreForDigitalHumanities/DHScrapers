I much prefer when an author can actual put together a reasonable plot line and bring it to an intelligent conclusion, rather than using shock and awe to finish off their book. I knew when I saw that Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl) recommended the book that I should abandon all hope. If you want to read about a psychopathic family, this book is for you. If you want a thought provoking book with any basis in reality, keep looking.</text></scrape>
