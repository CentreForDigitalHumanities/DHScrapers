I probably would have given it a 4, but for one small detail- that I probably shouldn't mention. However, it definitely would not have been a feel good 4, it would have been a ' this book makes me really uncomfortable and I don't like any of the characters, so I guess that means that the author did a pretty good job' 4. As it is, I think that Koch had something really interesting going, but then backed down by giving one of his characters an excuse for their terrible behaviour. So I'll leave it at a 3 for now.</text></scrape>
