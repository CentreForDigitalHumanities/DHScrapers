I have to confess, I don't have a lot of patience with those who dismiss this book simply because of the unlikeable characters. Of course, it goes without saying that anyone's reason for not liking a book is valid. You're allowed to not like the book for this or any other reason. But if you need likeable characters, and a comeuppance for all bad characters, well, frankly, you are in the WRONG SECTION OF THE LIBRARY.Ahem. Now that I got that out of the way...The book is clever, created in the framework of a dinner at a fine dining restaurant. The sections of the book follow the courses, from Aperitif all the way to Digestif. It takes place in Amsterdam, in an overpriced, hoity-toity restaurant, with two couples who are there to discuss their misbehaving sons.The narrator is funny, snarky, and is our tour guide through the evening. Koch uses delightful sleight of hand throughout the book until the final reveal of what's what, and who's who. He turns the reader into a voyeuristic snoop - I mean, don't we all thrill a little when watching a nasty scene erupt at someone else's table? No? Just me?There are a few weaknesses here, worth mentioning. I found it a little hard to believe that the couples would decide to discuss their sons in a public place, given the 'delicate' subject matter. Also, there are biological explanations given for bad behaviour that I didn't 100% buy. (Later, I came to realise that the "syndrome" described in the book is a metaphor for pathological entitlement which gets passed down from parent to child by a lifetime of examples.) But Koch's writing was strong enough to make me take a morsel, and then another, and before I knew it, I'd finished all courses a pretty happy customer.Many compare this to Gone Girl. From where I sit, this book borrows more from Crime and Punishment - shining a light on the moral elitism of those who believe they can decide that some lives are worth more than others. The entitlement of some people to do as they please, regardless of the consequences. Those who respond with a frightening smile or laugh in the face of a ghastly deed done to someone who "deserved it". And, even more chilling, enabling the next generation to be this way.It's dark and it's awful, but it didn't take my appetite away... I'm sure to read more by Herman Koch.</text></scrape>
