This is one of those books that will definitely stay with me --- I am giving it an extra star for this. I didn't particularly like the book, but I do admire the craft it took to write it. The plot device of using a dinner between couple to unfold a story was excellently done. I'm afraid that my judgement is clouded by the fact that I didn't like the characters or the actions of the characters to make me an impartial judge. Unfortunately, to describe too much will take away from the reading, so if you are curious and you don't have to like characters to enjoy the reading experience, give this one a try.</text></scrape>
