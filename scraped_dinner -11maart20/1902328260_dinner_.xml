It deals with mature subjects in an immature and not-previously-considered way, but trying to pass them as new and insightful and somehow better for being controversial.In short, I struggled through it, but couldn't help but feel it thought too highly of itself. And that's before we acknowledge how it tried to normalise subtle racist views and tried to pull in the reader to agree by presenting them as things everyone feels, brought up by one character and agreed by another.</text></scrape>
