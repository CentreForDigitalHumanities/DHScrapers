European Gone Girl? What a complete misled description. And an insult to Gone Girl. I found this story drawn out and full of useless information completely irrelevant to the story. The plot involves two couples dining at an expensive restaurant where the manager points to each dish with his pinky. Sounds dumb, right? Well, in this book this detail is brought up over and over again. The couples are narcissist people who are over titled and boring. There's nothing interesting about them except that Paul, who is also the narrator, has an anger problem and may or may not be bipolar. I can't add to this review without a spoiler so I'll stop now. Overall, this book was an annoying non-mystery with little peaks. </text></scrape>
