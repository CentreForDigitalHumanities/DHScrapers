In this case, though, for the first half of the book Paul appears to be merely a curmudgeon happy to gripe about the trendy upscale restaurant where his brother, Serge, and Serge's wife, Babette, have invited him and his wife, Claire, to dine; it isn't until the second half that Paul, his wife, and their son, Michel, are revealed to be a happy family of sociopaths.The net result, I'm afraid, confused me ... but then again, so did Burgess's point of view in Clockwork Orange. (Society perverting science to turn a troubled human being into a compliant automaton, bad. Troubled human being engaging in ultraviolence until -- oops! -- he accidentally murders an old woman, good -- or at least rollicking good fun.) When a novelist chooses to write in the first person I'm usually on the lookout for the kind of irony Mark Twain exploits so well in novels like Huckleberry Finn. So when Paul spends much of his time embroidering on his disgust for the PC Dutch establishment, or for his brother, who happens to be a celebrated political darling and a candidate for prime minister of The Netherlands, I'm uncertain what point of view I'm intended to take away -- especially after it becomes clear that Paul seems to be nothing more than a grown-up Alex. As with A Clockwork Orange, I felt I was forced to take sides between two unpalatable alternatives: what the author seems to portray as a sclerotic, conventional, contemptibly fearful social and political establishment or a devious, arrogant, violent man who, with his wife's loving connivance and encouragement, is content to cover up his 15-year-old son's vicious crimes.I'm left guessing that Herman Koch is perhaps comparing his narrator's (and his narrator's family's) outrageous moral deficits to those of what I'll call the Bush Era, which, admittedly, he mentions only in passing. Possibly Koch decided to create a family of monsters he believes embodies and reflects what he regards as Bush's global legacy of intolerance: the kind of careless, self-aggrandizing moral posturing that produced flimsy excuses for invading Iraq, dispatching Saddam Hussein, committing torture at Abu Ghraib, and, meanwhile, telling the rest of the world if it didn't agree with his half-baked ideas it could go f@$k itself.If that's not it, though, I'm afraid I'm out of ideas.P.S. To those who think this novel is intended to illustrate the hard choices parents must make when confronted with a child's horrific crime, allow me to point out the obvious: only Serge -- the brother whose peccadillos Paul enjoys skewering all evening -- has decided to do the right thing and turn his son in to the police ... and is prepared to throw away his political career to do so. That Koch foils Serge's intentions by setting his brother, his brother's wife, and even his own wife against him isn't intended to illustrate how parents may disagree about whether to discipline or protect their wayward children; instead, it's meant to be deeply ironic that only this supposedly vain, shallow, calculating politician has been willing to face facts, sacrifice his own future, and allow his son Rick to take responsibility for his actions. Indeed, perhaps the novel's ultimate implausibility is that Claire's attack on Serge, intended to preempt his decision to drop out of the race for prime minister, actually succeeds. It appears to be Koch's way of suggesting, cynically, that Serge's apparent declaration of scruples at dinner was only (pardon the pun) skin deep. It gives Koch the opportunity to end The Dinner the same way Burgess ends Clockwork Orange: with the unrepentant freed from their demons and (halleluyah!) back on top.</text></scrape>
