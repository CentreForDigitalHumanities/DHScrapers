(I suppose the blurb, taken out of context, refers to the sales success of this book in Europe, rather than its semblance to Gillian Flynn's taut thriller, given there's very little in common between the two books.). Mr. Koch's The Dinner is an effective page-turning morality play, and is worth a read, though if you're like me, you're probably going to take issue with the venue that the protagonists decide to air out their grievances. We're supposed to buy the idea that two brothers and their spouses are going to hash out the problems of their kids in an upscale Amsterdam eatery. I can set aside my loathing of nearly every character in this book, but when the the story is built on a rickety premise, it's difficult to wring much enjoyment out of reading it. </text></scrape>
