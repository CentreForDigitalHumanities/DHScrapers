I was expecting a tight, dialogue-driven book constrained by the device of taking place over a single meal, but it's actually heavily reliant on flashbacks and action away from the table. It wasn't helped by every character being both thoroughly unlikable and uncompelling, so I had no investment in any of it.</text></scrape>
