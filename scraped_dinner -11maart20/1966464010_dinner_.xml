The course of the novel mirrors the course of a dinner out: aperitif, appetizer, main course, dessert, and digestif, each section telling of the events of the dinner, and also of a meaningful past event. I will say I was shocked by how many poor reviews this book got. I thought it was great. First, the writing was excellent. The distinct skill of the author to really dig into the differing personalities of each main character was evident. The evolution of Paul, our narrator, transported him from a simple school teacher annoyed with having to spend an evening out with Serge, to a sinister, unreliable, dark threat was believable and unnerving. Koch's fine tuned ability to develop and deliver a good twist that wasn't over the top and hammering the reader over the head was much appreciated. The very first twist that occurred on page 20 was such a delicious surprise, and the perfect preview of what else was to come. I love the touches of developmental psychology, the debate of nature vs nurture, and the hints to neurology and biology, all completely vague, forgiving, and able to be interpreted by the reader in any which way they please. The end does leave me with some questions, and although I want answers, I don't need them. </text></scrape>
