Reading a book like that - one that defies your assumptions and charges down the path untaken - is what most of us look for from this form of entertainment, right?Well, this was a dark path and the people I met upon it are not the sort you want to meet after the sun goes down.The story starts off harmlessly enough. Paul Lohman and his wife Claire are meeting his brother Serge and Serge's wife, Babette, for dinner at a swanky restaurant. It's not just a casual night out, there's something they all need to talk about. A discussion about both of the couples' sons needs to be had. But that's not why Paul is annoyed. He seems to be bothered by... everything. The choice of restaurant, the waiter describing the food, even the guy who comes into the bathroom next to him. Claire is cautious too because Babette had been crying before they even reached the restaurant. Serge, who is on the political trail to become the next prime minister is his usual confident and demanding self, with something else lying just under the surface.By the time dessert is served, the gloves have come off and their lavishly prepared dinner has become only a backdrop to a frightful reality. One in which everything they each know is threatened by the actions of people that aren't even present at the table.I can say, thankfully, that I could not relate to any of these characters. They each had something dark and foreboding about them that made them monstrous in their own right, and our unreliable narrator, Paul, the chiefest among villains. Koch tells a cheerless but magnetic story where something obviously ominous is hovering over the dinner table at all times. As we start to learn what that "something" is, it's clear that the darkness isn't only present at the table, but within these characters and their relatives as well. I was left searching for even one redeeming character among them all - maybe Valerie, the daughter that is hardly mentioned?The Dinner is not humorous or endearing in any way so it was a very good read, but maybe not an enjoyable one, if that makes any sense. However, it did make me consider mental health issues much more seriously. By the end, I felt grateful for all the dinner parties I've been to that ended only with hugs and takeaway boxes.</text></scrape>
