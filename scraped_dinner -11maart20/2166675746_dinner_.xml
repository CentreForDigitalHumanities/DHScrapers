Or no, not regret. You say something so razor-sharp that the person you say it to carries it around with them for the rest of their life.” - Herman Koch - The Dinner🍷Wow. What to say about this book. It started out so painfully slow, I didn’t think I could do it. I looked at reviews and they said that it starts off slow, but when the incident is revealed, it picks up pace. So I stuck with it. It’s true that once the incident is revealed it picks up pace and I was definitely more interested in the storyline to see where it was going. Honestly, that was the only thing that kept me reading because I just wanted to know how it would all turn out. Then I just got so far into the book, I felt compelled to just finish. All the characters were just awful human beings. I have a hard time with books where I don’t relate to or like any of the characters. In fact, I would go as far as saying I’ve never read a book where I despised the characters more. There also seemed to be all these weird tangents that just seemed superfluous to the story. I had high hopes when I picked this one up, and I was majorly disappointed.</text></scrape>
