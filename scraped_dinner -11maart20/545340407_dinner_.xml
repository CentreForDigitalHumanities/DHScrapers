Don't get me wrong: it is an excellent book! So very much so that it kept me turning pages getting more and more upset by the minute. Paul and Claire meet up with Babette and Paul's very successful brother Serge for dinner at a high end restaurant. At first, conversation is light and superfluous; but as the courses keep coming, conversation starts getting serious. The four of them are there to discuss what they will do concerning both their teenage sons and a horrible act they have committed. Plot unfolds and as it does, we get flashbacks from Paul to other events in which disturbing things have happened. What unnerved me the most was Paul's narrative and his state of mind throughout all the book. Disturbing, upsetting, immoral and excellently written, The Dinner is a fabulous read and a perfect follow up for those who enjoyed Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl.</text></scrape>
