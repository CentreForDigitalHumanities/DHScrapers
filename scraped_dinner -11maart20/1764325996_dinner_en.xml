I wanted to read it last month but I just never found the time. Once I found an audio version, well I jumped right into it. In this book, you will meet two couples that are family. Each family has kids but they also have something else in common: one kid from each family did something bad. The two couples are out at dinner, trying to act normal. The two guys are brothers and the two girls are their wives. Of course, tension is there because something is off. Everyone has secrets.. ones that are about to come out.I loved all of the characters. Everyone was definitely hiding something from someone.. but they also had different agendas as well. No one was perfect... no matter how hard they tried to keep that image to the public. They are there to handle the kids drastic and horrible decision and no one can agree on the correct choice of action. Another thing to look out for, not one character is who you think they are throughout the book. Nope, once secrets come out.. you start to seem their true colors.So much happens in this book. The whole mystery throughout the book was good. Then there's the twists, and turns which would've been a page turner (if I had the physical book) but they still kept me highly engaged with the audio. I just wanted to know what was going to happen next. What secret I was going to find out. Most of all, I just wanted to know how this was all going to end!In the end, everyone was creepy and messed up in their own ways. I loved it. </text></scrape>
