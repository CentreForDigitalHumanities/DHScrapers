The best way for me to navigate this book is to just answer a selection of the book club readers questions at the end of the book. It is hard to unwrap a book with a narrator that you didn't realize at the beginning was unreliable while he tells about his family who you don't know at the time are all sociopaths. I enjoyed the way the book unwrapped slowly and tediously. Okay, here are my selected questions: 1) My initial opinion of Paul was that he was the more rational brother who was down to earth, but had a massive chip on his shoulder. I pictured Serge as a good-ole-boy sort who thought a lot about himself and no one else. But when I saw Serge give up his career for the right moral choice, you understand that it was a sociopath diagnosing someone else as a sociopath. 3) The sympathy that Clair and Paul feel for their son is excessive overkill to the point of alarming and terrifying. I understand the urge to protect your child. And if I am being perfectly honest with myself, I would probably feel the urge to suppress details of my children's involvement as well out of shame and fear. But, in the end, I never could go through with that- and I certainly would not make a righteous speech against the victim as though they had what was coming. 4) I definitely do not think that Rick and Michel represent an indifference of their generation, as I feel this generation is perhaps too tuned in and aware of how they appear to others and in doing the right thing. 6) I think Paul dislikes Serge largely because Serge represents a human depth (passion, integrity, loyalty etc) that Paul himself is unable to attain. You see a duplicate of this relationship in that of Michel (like Paul) and Rick (like Serge). 7) This is an interesting question. You would like it would take a sociopath to succeed in Politics and an empath to succeed in teacher. Perhaps this is too, though. As Serge could not ultimately be cut-throat enough in politics and Paul was unable to continue teaching. 8) The blame for the death of the homeless woman is totally on Rick and Michel. While you can delve deeper in a societal problem that put her on the streets in the first place, I reject the notion that the upper-class is unfeeling to this problem. Particularly in places like Holland were there are more resources. 10) I don't find Paul irrational. In fact, I find him rational to the point of unfeeling. His arguments for the victims not being automatically morally great people simply because they were victimized is technically true. Discussing how Jew who were killed were not good people just because they were killed was factual, but harsh. However, his belief that the world is better with less mediocre people is also possible fact based- but horrible at heart. 11) There was a interesting question of nature v nurture. Rick- although the murderer- felt horrible about it . The adopted son Beau- although not the murderer- used the opportunity to get himself more money. Perhaps this shows that Beau was choosing to live the rules of the family- even the standards- but feels differently in his heart. I personally don't believe this argument. I know the evidence may suggest that nature plays a larger role, but I find from my experiences that it is not that black and white. I think strong nurture can overshadow passive nature. However, it was the nurture side of Beau that taught him to go below the belt to get what he needs. He was adverse to murder, but not adverse to benefiting from it. 12) At a certain point you understand that Claire is as f$#ked up as her husband and son. So you understand that they are probably going to resort to murder of maiming in order to do it. But, you also think that maybe something will stop them from going through with it. That proves to be false. 13) It is interesting to consider the difference that would happen in this book if it was based in DC. Two things jump out: there are more homeless in DC and there are much harsher sentencing in DC as well. Paul often weighs his choices by how harsh the punishment is. Manslaughter in Holland will put him away for less than five years, but that could be life in DC. There would be less benefit to killing in DC than in Holland. </text></scrape>
