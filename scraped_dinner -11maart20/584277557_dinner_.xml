Did we read the same book??? I would say this was a book about nature vs nurture, evil, psychopathy and where it comes from. There are also lots of attempts to tie in these ideas with political and social structures - in my opinion that part was not fleshed out enough, and that was the most interesting part of the book for me. High marks for plotting and pacing - when students go to look up "unreliable narrator" this guy's picture should be there! Great job of the slow reveal. What didn't work were the many many instances where things were only partly revealed, such as an illness one character suffers, a "syndrome" another is diagnosed with - never explained, and it was quite annoying to me.Another thing I did enjoy was the humor about the dinner itself. Those parts were hilarious, and an interesting contrast to the topic of conversation. Here are people gathered to discuss a horrific brutal thing their children have done, while hoity toity wait staff drone on about the tender lettuce leaves and the happy contented lives of the chickens they are eating. I love a book, fiction or non, about the nature of evil. But, this is a very pessimistic and misanthropic story. No one is a good person. If we're going to understand evil, we have to look at what is good in people as well. While I could not put the book down, it was not enjoyable. When I finished, I went right to the bookshelf and picked up Mayor of Casterbridge - longing for a story about someone flawed but basically noble!</text></scrape>
