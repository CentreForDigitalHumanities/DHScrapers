That’s the basic, but over time it emerges that the men are brothers, the one despises the other, the “problem “ is actually murder, the one brother is a sociopath and -do I need to continue? Told in present and flashbacks, the dinner first seems like two couples who are meeting for social obligations with amusing little asides about the pretensions of the upper class and the people who cater to them. Then some interesting descriptions of Dutch society, travellers and institutions. Only when the reader is halfway in does the narrator begin to be revealed as a total asshole and sociopath. By then I was thinking it wouldn’t go on in that vein, but unfortunately it did only got worse. Not recommended.</text></scrape>
