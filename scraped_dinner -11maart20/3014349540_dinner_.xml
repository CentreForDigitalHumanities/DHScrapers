Absolute boring rubbish. That's the last time I take a book recommendation from a famous author. I quite enjoyed the start of it, but then it tailed off into utter nonsense, with very unlikable characters. I only finished it because I felt it had to improve, but it didn't. That's several hours of my life I will never get back.</text></scrape>
