All four are aware that their two families share a terrible secret that has for too long gone unaddressed, but they put off any discussion of it while the opening courses are served. This first one-third of the novel is satire of the kind you laugh at: the pretensions of the diners, the meal and the restaurant, the faux man-of-the-people persona of Serge, the politician, the acerbic observations of his brother, Paul, our narrator . . . Although the style of humor is very different, I felt as if I were living in the middle of the long restaurant sequence in Jacques Tati's movie Playtime (1967).But then things turn darker, very much darker, as we learn of the horrible crime(s) the two couples' sons have committed, and the parents' reactions to the circumstance. The people with whom we earlier identified prove to be rotten, a thin veneer of smug respectability covering their fairly vile personalities. Meanwhile Serge, whom we had earlier concluded to be a shallow, false-faced buffoon, a laughing-stock, is the only one to show any level of moral integrity. It's a wonderful volte-face -- two of them, really, if you count the switch between the two types of satire. Now the focus is on the nasty underside of seemingly civilized society and, while there are still some witticisms, Koch's knives are assuredly out.Somehow, in the midst of all this, the novel manages to be a very effective thriller too.I bought this book about a year ago but put off reading it because the blurb made it sound a bit stiff. A whole novel set during a single dinner? Really? But, when I finally took the plunge, I was immediately snared. Much recommended.</text></scrape>
