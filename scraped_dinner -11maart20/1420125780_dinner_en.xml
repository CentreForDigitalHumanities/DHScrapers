Much of the public commentary on this book frames it as a drama about "what a parent might do for love--to protect their children." In my opinion, this misses the point, and the reason I believe that comes at the very end of the book. No spoilers, but there is an understanding between father and son about entitlement trumping justice.In light of revelations about Donald Trump, Jr.'s knowingly meeting with a Russian lawyer, believing he and his cohorts were going to receive damning intelligence information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government, which was working on Trump's behalf to elect him, I cannot stop thinking about this book, because for me, it answers all the motivation questions and explains the Teflon-covered certainty that the behavior was okay.The story takes place over a dinner between two couples—two brothers and their wives— and it plays out like a chess game. The players strategize. The first-person narrative of the brother, Paul, who is telling the story feels sometimes like a director’s commentary on a DVD movie; in this case there is a gap between what happens and Paul’s behind-the-scenes knowledge and twisted concerns. There are horrendous crimes. There is strategizing to un-know them, rewrite them, or make them disappear.This is a psychological thriller. Not my usual fare. But what makes it most compelling for me is that it answers questions I’ve long puzzled over regarding a certain kind of upper-crust White privilege (in this story, a possible metaphor as an unnamed genetically transmitted disorder). I’ve seen symptoms of this disorder most of my life. As of this update to my review, I'm thinking only about current news, but I have had other experiences:I live next door to a building many of us used to call a frat house when most of the apartments were rented by youngish (thirties) White men who worked on Wall Street and held wild parties, blasting music into the common airspace of the backyard and terraces. Once, when my neighbor who lived in the garden apartment of my building complained, the party host hoisted huge ice blocks over their common wall and threw them into her yard. Another time, after I called the cops at around 2 a.m., it got quiet for a few minutes. Then as soon as the police officer left, a booming male chant erupted: “We will party all night! We will party all night!” Another time, when a number of partygoers—very handsome, collegiate-looking young men—were gathered on the sidewalk, one of them decided to try to break a branch off a young tree outside my building. When I yelled, “Don’t hurt that tree,” he came after me. As I went into my vestibule, he followed. In a jaunty, easy walk, with a look to charm in his eyes that I will never forget, he tried to push in my front door and he seemed surprised when I pushed back and managed to escape. The frat house landlady told me these men cared nothing about the noise fines or attorneys’ fees because money was like water to them. It took years for her to evict the one in the garden apartment; fighting in court became a game to the tenant.The Dinner finally answers my question about how somebody becomes that way. How does one get this disorder, characterized by certainty that he can do as he pleases, hurt anyone who displeases him, and he is above the law? How does he come to assume that the law will be on his side, he will always get more chances and can put whatever “mistake” he’s made behind him, and how is it that this is often the case? People become this way because they inherit the beliefs through their repeated teaching from parents to children—in the book, it is a DNA-testable disorder. People are taught to become this way by parents in prominent positions who are this way. They are taught by their experiences in a society that reinforces the entitlement.Here is an excellent piece by NY Times writer David Brooks on the legacy of our current toxic situation. Writes Brooks: It takes generations to hammer ethical considerations out of a person’s mind and to replace them entirely with the ruthless logic of winning and losing; to take the normal human yearning to be good and replace it with a single-minded desire for material conquest; to take the normal human instinct for kindness and replace it with a law-of-the-jungle mentality. . . .The Donald Trump Jr. we see through the Russia scandal story is not malevolent: He seems to be simply oblivious to the idea that ethical concerns could possibly play a role in everyday life. </text></scrape>
