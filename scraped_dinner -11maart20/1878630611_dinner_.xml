The setting is unbelievable and I couldn't visualize these adults speaking about the "violent act" that took place, in a crowded restaurant, especially with one of the adults being a well know politician. There are a few things that bother me, but for the sake of not spoiling it, I won't go into further detail. This is just my opinion, but again, I can see why a lot of people would enjoy a story like this. It's the shock and the, "I can't believe it, how could that happen?" feeling we all get sometimes when reading a book. Some execute stories like this better than others, and for me, this wasn't hitting that spot.</text></scrape>
