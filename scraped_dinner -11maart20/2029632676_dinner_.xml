Probably deserves more than a 3-star rating but I'm not feeling particularly charitable today. The characters are unlikeable twats, this doesn't usually bother me but for some reason,I can't quite put my finger on it, something didn't balance well here.It's hard to care about the outcome of a story when you don't give a toss about the characters-as it turns out it ended in a whimper.I enjoyed the writing style and the premise just not the cardboard cutouts and their culinary preferences. </text></scrape>
