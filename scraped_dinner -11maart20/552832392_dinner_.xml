I seriously feel like I need to take a shower . . . or maybe seek a couple sessions of therapy. You need to feel completely comfortable hanging out on the dark side to get through this story. I thought I was comfortable, but I almost chickened out reading the end. It gets that crazy.I've seen this book compared to Gone Girl a few times. But, this book takes disturbing behavior to a whole new level. These characters make Amy and Nick look like they're playing in the junior league of crazies.I really don't know how I felt about the book. I didn't hate it, but I pretty much hated all of the characters. I didn't enjoy the experience of reading the book. But, I'm dying to discuss it with someone else. But, I'm uncomfortable recommending the book to friends. I gave it a three, because I don't know what else to give it.I need a hug.</text></scrape>
