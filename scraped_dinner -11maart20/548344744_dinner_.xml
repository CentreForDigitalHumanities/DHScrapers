You don't even love to hate this guy he is just so opinionated and uninteresting.Luckily, as the dinner progresses, the reader is fed flashbacks that are meant to reveal tension and conflict between the dinner guests because of a some dark event in the past.The novel heavy-handedly leads us to believe it has secrets, and every time it appears that the author is going to reveal a secret (like, 10 times throughout the book), he cuts the narrative entirely, switches to another scene, and leaves the reader clinging to air. He builds it up, and that is it; no pay-off, not even a cliff to hang on to. Fabula Interruptus. Koch performs a horrible trick with the structure of this book that is so frustrating it may make you stop reading altogether.In the end, the secret is juicy but lacks the flavour to make this a memorable meal. In the morning you will regret having eaten so much.2.5/5</text></scrape>
