Two couples have dinner to discuss something terrible that their children have done. I really enjoyed the way this took place at a nice restaurant (sensitive subjects are being discussed and there's constant interruptions and a certain demeanor must be kept) and that it was separated into courses. I liked the unlikeable characters and the satirical nature of it. It was interesting- I listened to the whole audiobook in one day! </text></scrape>
