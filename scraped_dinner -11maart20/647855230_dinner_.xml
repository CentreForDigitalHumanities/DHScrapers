I'm so glad that I took his recommendation. I can honestly say that I didn't like any of the characters in this book, and I would have come away with entirely different feelings about it if I had read the print version (like 2.5 stars feelings). The audiobook performance by Clive Mantle, however, was spectacular (leaving me with more like 3.75 feelings).As suggested by the title, almost the entire book takes place immediately before, during, and after a dinner between two couples. None of the characters are likable (with the exception of a few minor characters without names who flit on the edges of the story). At first I felt for the narrator, Paul, who seems like a person who has always lived in someone else's shadow. But, it soon became clear that he is a bad parent and generally terrible human with anger issues, an inferiority complex, and feelings of entitlement that made me roll my eyes and scoff. Throughout the book, Paul denigrates his brother, Serge, the character who I ended up empathizing with the most. Paul's wife, Claire, and Serge's wife, Babette, seem okay in the beginning; but I ended up disliking both of them too, though for different reasons.Despite these unlikable characters, the story is really interesting and gripping. Koch reveals the mysteries of the novel slowly - piece by frustrating piece - so that I kept listening in order to figure out what had happened/what was going to happen! The way Paul narrates the story is so believable too, particularly in the first half of the book. He muses about the people at the restaurant, the food, the service, which is interspersed with the kinds of thoughts and memories that often pass through one's mind during social interactions ... like a dinner. The last third of the book was the most frustrating, and I ultimately came away feeling a bit dissatisfied. Overall, it's a pretty dark story. But, even though I know I'm not selling it very well, the audiobook is amazing and I cannot emphasize enough how great Clive Mantle's performance was. Also, the way he said "Serrrggge" was just great.</text></scrape>
