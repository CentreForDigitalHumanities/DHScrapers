First of all it is a foodie type book and I do love my foodie books. It is also very intriguing that the entire book is set around this one dinner. Told through flash backs and present time, from pleasant chit-chat around the subject of politics, menu choices, family and then… We need to talk about our children. I really enjoyed this book on audio. Narrators Sam Garrett and Clive Mantle were appropriately chilling in their telling of this story that is fed to the reader/listener forkful by forkful. I am glad I listened to it on audio, I feel it gave the story line a higher level of understanding and I especially enjoyed having the story unfold from Paul’s perspective.Witty and a bit dangerous ( a little bit of a Jo Nesbo tamed down feel)… I did enjoy The Dinner.
