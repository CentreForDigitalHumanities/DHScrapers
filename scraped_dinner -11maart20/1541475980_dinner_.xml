I felt that I had been given privy to the secret, insightful thoughts of someone likable, and then gradually I was drawn in, and the truth kept twisting, and then I was wishing that I could keep reading, but with my eyes closed. This is the kind of book that is so frustrating when you don't know anyone to discuss it with immediately, as it raises horrifying questions of "What would you do?" and "Why did they do that?" Beautiful written and horrifyingly disturbing.</text></scrape>
