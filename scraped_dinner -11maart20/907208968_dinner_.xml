Normally, I can pick it up and set it aside, read it when I please, and finish it over the next couple weeks. But not The Dinner. In this way, it felt like a YA novel (the content is a totally different story). This is most likely the case because of its structure, which takes place over the course of …wait for it… a single dinner. And yet, this is a train that picks up steam, and is only going to build and go faster and stronger. It involves two couples, dining together at a fancy restaurant. They’re there to discuss their teenage boys and the terrible act that they committed --and was caught on camera-- but like most outings at fancy restaurants by fancy people, appearances need to be made, reputations upheld, and egos to be massaged before we get to the meat and potatoes. And as the reader, or simply, an observer of people, you have to love the nuances and games Koch employs while these characters are forced to endure this meal together. It’s pretty vicious stuff. There is a portion of the book that takes us out of the dinner, as the narrator, Paul, fills us in on his more recent personal battle. I will say that this did cause some separation from the immediate narrative for me (that I just wanted to get back to the dinner!), but as a whole, it gives the novel much more weight because of it. Koch is able to create a discussion on upper vs. lower class, nature vs. nurture, and restaurant ridiculousness. Deeeeelish. Buy this from Powell's.</text></scrape>
