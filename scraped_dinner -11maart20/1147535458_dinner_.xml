It is nowhere near that level.This book felt like it started as a philosophy experiment that someone then tried to flesh out into a novel by padding it full of minutiae about fine dining and restaurant etiquette in Europe. In theory, the entire book takes place over the course of one expensive dinner, though in practice the author has to jump around and tell a few stories from prior to the dinner in order to provide the context for what ultimately unfolds. There are essentially five main characters in this novel, and I didn't find any of them to be particularly likeable or sympathetic, least of all the narrator himself. He starts out being slightly irritating in his fussiness over food, etiquette, etc (which honestly consumes about the first 1/3 of the book) and as the story unfolds, he reveals himself to be a mentally ill monster at some key times, a milquetoast at most others. My lack of a connection with any of the characters is partly why I say this felt more like a philosophical exercise than a human story, but there are other reasons I say that as well. The escalation of the drama is dependent on the actions of the characters, and on more than one occasion, I felt like the characters were having unrealistic, extreme reactions that in a more human story would not have come until after they'd exhausted several other avenues first.That said, for a book in translation, I found the pacing to be pretty good (once you get through the first half.) I won't exactly say it's a page-turner, but it has elements of that at times. And if you're a person who finds philosophical dilemmas more interesting than human stories, you might love this one.</text></scrape>
