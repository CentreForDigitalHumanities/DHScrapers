I did not like any of the characters and was creeped out by the father and son. The book is about two brothers who have dinner with their wives out at a fancy restaurant. Throughout the dinner the father is recounting the horrific murder that his son and nephew commit against a homeless woman. Dark doesn't begin to describe this book. I honestly wish I hadn't wasted my time on this book. Do not recommend.</text></scrape>
