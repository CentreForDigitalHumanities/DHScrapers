For a while the reader is unsure whether Claire knows, but Serge and his brother Paul carry on with their usual conversations.The book is set over one evening and initially draws on past events effectively to weave the story. However from about halfway the author spends whole chapters on past events and the book seems to lose its way.It was annoying the way the author omitted certain details, names of schools, hospitals, restaurants, it wouldn't have made a difference.The end was disappointing and Claire, who seemed grounded, proved to be even more unbalanced than the boys.The discussions I thought this would provoke, didn't really happen, the parents own interests seemed to be their top priority.</text></scrape>
