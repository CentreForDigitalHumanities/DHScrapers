Serge is a Dutch politician who expects to be elected prime minister. Paul is not Serge’s fan. Paul is the voice in this funny and wicked novel. He and his smarter-than-Paul wife have been invited to a grand restaurant by Serge and his smarter-than-Serge wife. Paul dreads the evening: he despises his sanctimonious brother almost as much as he detests the waiter, whose dangling pinky finger points at the miniscule food orts as he describes its qualities. The evening begins with verbal jabs, but, as it proceeds, the wine flows, the conversation darkens, and the backstory develops. Paul and Claire have a less-than-perfect child, who has committed a horrid act along with Serge and Babette’s son. The Dinner is an attempt to come to agreement on how this should be addressed. Important moral questions are in play, and as you read on the onion layers peel off and you see Paul and Claire more clearly. This is a compelling story about the baggage we bring into our families and the effect that has on our coping with the vicissitudes of life. Our narrator has a biting humor and a façade masking a damaged mind, his wife is a quasi-Lady Macbeth—and it is all so human. The story has a pleasant aftertaste, ending with just enough left unrevealed to keep you thinking; it is a modern morality tale with bite. I give it five stars, though I see that the Goodreads rating is much lower—many readers are left cod, others are inspired. It’s that kind of book.</text></scrape>
