A mixture of psychology and confusion on my part. Without giving too much away, the book is mostly set in an expensive restaurant in The Netherlands. The four dinner members are two brothers and their wives. There is a lot of bantering between the two rivalry brothers..one a politician running for a high office and the other a forced retired high school history teacher. This is no ordinary dinner gathering. The food takes a back seat to the anger dispensed at the table by the two brothers and later by their wives towards each other. The main focus is the problems these couples have relating to the crime their two sons have committed but also how they relate to each other and the underlying anger each of the dinner guests harbors. An odd ending to this book to say the least.</text></scrape>
