A few years ago, I instituted a personal policy to no longer read books authored by cis white men (with the exception of Neil Gaiman because he transcends time, space, gender, & dimension). But, I had put this book on my want to read list 4 years ago and figured I could make an exception just this once as I randomly came across it in the library. Yikes on MFing ableist bikes, what did I just subject my face eyes to? This is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I have ever read. First, blaming the main characters’ issues on what is obviously supposed to be Asperger’s syndrome is beyond the pale. People with autism are not conniving murderers because of a genetic malformation. In fact, they are far more likely to be the recipients of violence rather than the instigators. So maybe we don’t need to promote popular fiction that elevates ableist tropes against an already marginalized population? Second, wouldn’t it be nice if psychopaths acted like monsters 100% of the time? This book helps maintain that fantasy which helps real life abusers to benefit.This book does actual harm. </text></scrape>
