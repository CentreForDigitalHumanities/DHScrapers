Actually like is the wrong word. You can't really like this book, but it gets under your skin and before you know it, you're sucked in to this horrible story surrounded by horrible people. If you need to have someone you can relate to or identify with DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. I see people critiquing it for not identifying with anyone, but like that's kinda the point? I mean if you did identify with anyone, you may want to see a therapist.Pros: The characters. Oh my god, they were nasty and manipulative and selfish. I wish I could say they didn't feel real, but they did. I could totally imagine this scenario actually happening with these kind of people. It was so interesting to see the lengths people go to for their children and family. How people treat their kids opposed to a stranger or even their brother. I loved this study of how dark people can be. The atmosphere is stifling. It's claustrophobic and even in the flashbacks the tension is constantly building. It was both frustrating and exciting, I couldn't put it down. Cons: There were some things I felt were left a bit unexplained. I actually wanted it to be longer. There was still some questions I had and the ending was so sudden after a slow, detailed build up. I feel like more details at the end would have helped strengthen the story. But, it is called 'the dinner' and the novel only goes for the length of this dinner. Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book. I found it to be unique, atmospheric and engrossing. I don't think it is for everyone, as I said, if you need a character to relate to, this isn't the book for you. However, if you want an interesting look in to how people excuse horrible things and take selfishness to a whole new level, this is a book for you!</text></scrape>
