You finish it reluctantly... perhaps the ending would make up for some of it." Herman Koch The DinnerThat's not true of all bad books, but it is true for this one. The plot is horrific, but I kept reading because I was hoping to see some amount of justice by the end. I wanted the book to redeem itself. I wanted an ending that made me feel like this wasn't a massive waste of my time.No such justification ever happened and I have no idea what enjoyment anyone could get from this story. It's one full of terrible people plotting to keep their monstrous offspring safe from the law after an act of unspeakable horror has been committed. It's a story about mental illness that seems to portray those who have it as irredeemable. It's a story that can't get to the point and is about 100 pages too long.There was rarely a sense of suspense. It would crop up from time to time only to disappear as the narrator once again went on a rambling side story where he reminisced about his past. These tales were clearly meant to establish who his was and what his issues were, but there were far too many of them. The point would have been perfectly clear with half as many or with most of them dramatically decreased in length.The same goes for the dinner itself which is far too long and, truth be told, makes very little sense. Who goes to a public restaurant to have a private family talk? That's got to be doubly true for political figures like the main character's brother.I don't know, there's just nothing good to say about this one. I have no idea why Herman Koch wrote this or what people are getting from it. It's not a good story nor is it one that makes you think unless inspiring thoughts such as "dear God these people are horrible" counts as making you think.</text></scrape>
