It’s full of totally unlikeable and morally bankrupt characters and told by an absolutely unreliable narrator but if you’re like me, you’ll want to linger with it through dessert and afterwards.The premise: two brothers, Paul and Serge, and their wives, Claire and Babette, meet for dinner one evening in an exorbitantly pricey and pretentious restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam. Serge and Babette are well known; in fact, Serge is just a breath away from becoming Holland’s next Prime Minister. Paul – our narrator and a former teacher who is now non-active – is simmering with bitterness and animosity at his far more successful brother.Each couple has a 15-year-old son; they are, of course, first cousins. Serge and Babette are also parents to another son whom they adopted in Africa. We know immediately that the boys have gotten into some kind of trouble, but the narrator withholds from us exactly what the nature of that trouble is. The unspoken question at the table becomes “how far would you go to protect the ones you love?” As the horrific teenage transgression is gradually revealed, the grotesqueness of each set of parents also begins to uncover. Apertif and appetizer make way to entrée and dessert, yet surrounded by the trappings of civilization, these two couples are anything but civilized. Frustrations, dissatisfactions, and resentments from the past are mixed in a cauldron that can easily bubble over. Yet Paul is so unreliable that we – the readers – must question what is true and what is not in his assessments of the situation.The Dinner is compulsively page-turning, touching on the nature versus nurture conundrum and the public masks we wear. There’s always a sense of menace that lurks right beneath the surface. The book has been compared to Christos Tsiolkas’s The Slap but also there’s a touch of Reza’s God of Carnage, Lindsay’s Defending Jacob and Shriver’s We Need To Talk About Kevin. With few missteps, it’s good to the last drop.</text></scrape>
