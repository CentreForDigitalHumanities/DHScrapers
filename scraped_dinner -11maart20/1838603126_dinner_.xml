This book. It was... oh so... I had so many thoughts when the last words of this book ran through. Strange. Well written. What??? Seriously? Ok... What the?This book was so many things. I loved and hated the main characters. I had no idea where this book was going (which was great, I normally figure out plots pretty quickly, it was delightful to be surprised). To say that I loved it is too strong. Parts of this book are just plain despicable, and yet, I believe that was the point. The way that the author used the wording to go back and forth between how he used pronouns and nouns.... ah, it was so interesting! I would definitely tell you to give this book a read. Just be ready to be slightly disturbed. It takes you in some weird places. </text></scrape>
