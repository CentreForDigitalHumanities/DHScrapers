I have no idea why this book is even compared to it. Gone Girl is captivating and compelling right from the start. The (GG) story had my attention right from page 1. This book takes you about 100 pages to even start to get into it and by the time you reach that point you don't give a poop.I don't know if this book would have earned more stars if I finished it but, I didn't. It may have picked up towards the end, but to be honest, I couldn't finish it and I just didn't care. There is entirely too much descriptive writing and not enough on actually developing the story. Who cares to read 3 pages worth of a description of an appetizer? Especially since it serves no purpose in plot development? My recommendation is to pass over this book and go on to read the next one on your list.</text></scrape>
