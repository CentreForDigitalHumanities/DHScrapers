This book seems to tackle weighty issues like how children turn into criminals and what to do with them when they do, but Koch has no real insight into the subject. However, if the end of this novel had been sharply edited, it would have been more memorable and unsettling. By the time it's clear how far the narrator's wife is prepared to go to protect their son, the author should leave well alone and stop. The last few chapters are full of unnecessary and implausible details (for instance, if the fancy restaurant owner is prepared to blackmail the Lohmans, why would he shut up for a mere 500 euros?), a pity when most of the narrative is lean and taut. Also, I fail to understand why Serge decides to continue with his campaign, after the disappearance of Beau should have strengthened his determination to let his son and nephew answer for their actions. Judging by the number of puzzled posts on the site, it's clear to me that there is a problem with the ending and I can only wonder why the publisher let such a valuable commodity go forward in this shape. </text></scrape>
