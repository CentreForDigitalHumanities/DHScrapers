The people who appear sympathetic at first may not be who they seem. It was an interesting way to tell the story, with references to the actual dinner/courses and flashbacks. Now that I am finished and reflect on the overall story, I can say that I really enjoyed this one. The references to Dutch culture also interested me; for example, the 18 year son telling his parents he carries a lighter to light girls' cigarettes and joints. I'm not sure I can picture that same conversation about joints in America! This is the first book I have read by this author, but I would definitely try another.</text></scrape>
