Should you be able to find the 3 hours of sustained time, or break it up into two shorter periods, you'll read on as this upper class posh family unravels with secrets foretold in the tagline to the title: how far will you go to protect your children?It's that nature v nurture discussion that this book will provoke, as what starts off to be likeable characters devolves into appalling ids of people. The book is laid out over one evening dinner between two related couples brought together to discuss their kids, with back story interjected between courses revealing the dark issues underlying the discussion. Filled with shock, deception, deceit, and all of the fun you'd expect that comes with that, the perfect happy family is shown to be anything but. Worthwhile for anyone intrigued in wanting to know more... perhaps a great plane or beach read for someone who needs a gripping well written story.</text></scrape>
