Paul goes to a restaurant with his wife, Claire to meet his brother and his wife Babette. The restaurant is fancy, both Paul and Claire feel out of place but this meeting is important. Serge is a politician and the secret that the brothers and their wives hold could change their families lives forever. This book talked about food a lot, it wasn't really needed even though I realised that the author was trying to portray a higher class setting. The fact that they met at a restaurant was unneeded, especially because the secret was quite serious I thought it was stupid to talk out in the open about it. I didn't like Paul at all, his behaviour was odd and his thoughts about people was cruel at times. The secret that they all shared was underwhelming, it was a big secret but it didn't have any shock value to me. I didn't buy into the story and there wasn't any connection between the characters that I could relate to in any way. The ending was bizarre, Paul pays off their waiter to not mention anything to anyone about what he heard which could have been avoided if they met somewhere more private. Claire ends up doing something drastic to stop Serge making a massive press release that could change their lives for the worst. I don't think any of the characters deserved to get away with what the family, particularly the sons did. I suppose the good thing about this book was that it made me think about right and wrongs and what the limits are when it comes to crime. </text></scrape>
