A simple plot with great potential that ultimately never came to fruition to me.First off, the prose itself was bland and forgettable. My pen was ready to mark and underline any phrase or paragraph that caught my fancy but never made a scratch on the paper. A lot of the phrasing was incredibly redundant for absolutely no reason. The narrator would reiterate the same few words at the end of a sentence two or three more times by the end with no added effect save annoying me, the reader. The only section of the book where I feel the prose fulfilled the author's intent was the description of the head waiter annoying the narrator with how he presented the food presented at the table.The plot and characters also gave a brief, tantalizing look of intrigue before stumbling over their own lack of morals into a misaligned pile of skulduggery and violence that offered no redeeming qualities. In the beginning, I felt the elder brother, Serge, was to be the villain; he was rich, powerful, and had an air of condescension and unbridled egotism about him as well as a plastic trophy wife on his arm. His younger brother, the narrator, seemed like the sympathetic shadow, continually dwarfed by his titan of a sibling. His wife, Claire, is smart and calm and steadfast in sticking by her humble lovers side. But then everything flops in a very unexpected and unrewarding manner. In fact, every character is ultimately revealed as utterly lacking in morals and the cathartic defeat of one only implies the disappointing success of another.In terms of the plot, there were several details that, while not quite plot holes, made the fabric of the story too slackened for my liking. The narrator is revealed as an incredibly violent man who repeatedly beats people to an inch of their lives (both in private and in public) and faces absolutely no repercussions for it. This is never explained and not even given a lampshade hanging. Similarly, Claire, who at first appeared by far the most normal of the four, turns out to love not the medicated and sedated version of her husband, but the violent, red-blooded, over-eager pugilist of a man and encourages him. Why? Why, living in an upper middle class family with no visible or mentioned woes, would she prefer this monster of a man who, based on his erratic behavior, may turn on her at any moment? While arguably this attraction is true within the fiction of the story, it seemed too far fetched for me to be the unbreakable chain that kept the family together. In addition to this, she follows closely in her husbands footsteps and slashes Serge with a broken wine glass to further her own purposes. Again, no repercussions (Why? What would remaining quiet serve? The only thing it would do would ruin the plot Koch was aiming for, so it is never fully discussed at length). Were they just a loving, ultra violent family? In the society Koch painted, that seems like an inherent contradiction.Then there is the case in point of the two boys who caused the eponymous dinner to take place. Serge's adopted son knows of their crime and blackmails them, but for what? His father is about to become Prime Minister. They all ready have a great amount of money. The boy appears to have everything he could want both materially and emotionally, but immediately feels blackmail is the prime path to take. In addition to this, the boy is shown to be in cahoots with the two boys previous troubles; in flashbacks, he's one of them, being dragged by his ear away from the authorities by whatever hooliganism they've just acted out. The impression is given that he shares a great deal of their mentality (and the two boys, especially Michel, the narrator's son, is shown as having always been a deviant), but is also the first to immediately betray them. Perhaps his lack of morals was greater than theirs, but then why did he not participate in their penultimate crime? That entire subplot and it's incredibly unrewarding resolution (a rather obvious murder that is implied to be unsolved and with no clues) just drags the book down farther.There was nothing satisfying about this book. In the end, all the character's were evil and for no thematic reason other than 'They just are.' I've read books before where the vast majority of the book was composed of evil characters. In fact, my favorite book of all time, Blood Meridian, does this to a greater degree than The Dinner. But the difference is twofold; the first is that there is some fight against the evil (even if it is ultimately useless) and the second is that the evil has a purpose and is representative of some facet of humanity we all share. In 'The Dinner', the closest thing to a redeeming character is Serge, who in the end tucks his tail and runs despite having all the power in his hands, presenting the villains their victory on a silver platter. This is in no way enticing for a reader. There is no existential of nihilistic viewpoint behind it that makes one question the roles of good and evil or the futility of virtue; they are simply villains who win because of the utter incompetence of the only character remotely close to moral. The reason for the narrator's evil in the book is that he is born with a rare disease that causes a mental unbalance. How horribly unfulfilling. it would be like explaining the love of a horribly romantic couple on brain damage instead of the appeal of the characters. Making the story come from this wholly foreign person's eyes only distances myself from my entertainment in the story.The only reason I wouldn't give this book one star out of five is that it did what it tried to accomplish; build suspense and drama in the characters. Unfortunately, Koch chose a suspense and drama I could not care lass about and backed it with a poorly thought out and unbelievable characters in a story that revolved around realism.</text></scrape>
