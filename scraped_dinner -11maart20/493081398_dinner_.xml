The story starts out with a husband and wife sitting in a cafe enjoying a quiet drink before meeting his brother and sister-in-law at a chic restaurant. The couple knows that the brother (a successful politician) will be able to get a table and undivided attention from the waitstaff that they could never get on their own. Each section of the story is laid out like a dinner from aperitif to digestif and by the time you get to the appetizers you will be hooked. I thought this would be a bit like Defending Jacob as soon as I found the topic of discussion to be about both couples sons but I was wrong - it is much more convoluted of a plot. Twists and turns keep you guessing who is right until you realize they are all a mess. The book is an international bestseller that has been translated from the Dutch to be released in February in this country. I was fortunate enough to read an advance copy from the publisher. The Dinner will fill your hunger but beware like all big rich meals , it may leave you with a sour stomach. This book will be the topic of conversation in many book clubs this spring - bon appetit !</text></scrape>
