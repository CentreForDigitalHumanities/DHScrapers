(Have I been doing that a lot lately? I feel like I've been doing that a lot. Is my reading comprehension upon check-out at bookstores dropping, or am I just more scrutinizing now that I actually write book descriptions--albeit for a very different genre--for a living?) The back cover of the book gives you as little information about the actual book possible, but, then again, in all fairness, it sort of does tell you 90% of what you need to know about the story. (I'm wondering here if the whole "spoiler!culture" is contributing to any of these book-description issues...hmm..)I'll concede on this one and let go of my misguided notions about what this book would be about and instead focus on what it's actually about. It's about two brothers and their wives dealing with the fact that their kids committed a series of inhumane acts that led to the accidental death of a homeless woman. And then they went out and tried to do it again, basically. So. Not great. Lots of not-fun, depressing stuff there. But then, also, by the way, 3/4 parents are psychopaths as well and literally don't care, apparently.I think this book would have been more bearable as a short story. Or maybe if more than 25% of the characters hadn't been total sociopaths. Ironically, the only sane adult with a working moral compass in this entire book is the politician, who, despite his totally reasonable plan of making the boys confess and take responsibility, the narrator still manages to make you hate because the narrator is also a total psychopath.Now, I hate labelling characters like that, but honestly, in this book... It feels very apt. I get parents wanting to protect their children, but I think there's a certain line between not wanting them to go to jail (and so covering it up, not admitting to anything, etc) and justifying their actions to yourself and everyone around you.I don't really know if I want to get into the why's and why not's of all of it, or the moral reasoning behind it, or even really attempt any sort of character analysis here because the thought of it is kind of exhausting. The father/narrator, Paul, is petty and irritated by every single little thing possible with perhaps the exception of his wife's face, a fact that seeps into the narrative and makes me, as a reader, petty and irritated with the book as a whole. He flies into a rage at little things--apparently due to some sort of disorder which he refuses to name, w/e, okay, sure--and sounds like an absolute lunatic as he describes beating up his son's principal (to the point of putting him in the hospital!!) over the principal's criticism of his son's paper (which Paul helped write, which talks about how police/the government/vigilantes should just murder obviously evil/guilty prisoners instead of putting them through trials and/or the death penalty, etc) and what Paul perceives as criticism of himself and his mental state. He beats his own brother across the face with a kitchen pot because the brother and his wife suggested that Paul's son stay with them for a few days while Paul's wife had a lengthy stay in the hospital... I mean, I could go on, but I really don't need to, do I?In some ways, I guess, I could relate to Paul--not in the anger issues way, but in the sense that Paul always felt like everyone was scrutinizing him, watching him the way, I guess, he watches everyone else through the novel. There's a great quote somewhere about how women become spectators of themselves because they spend so much time watching themselves be watched, etc, and so I get the uber self-consciousness of Paul's narrative, but also... Meh. I'm kind of tired of white-guy narratives where the guy's a total asshole and I'm supposed to find this "revolutionary" or "riveting." I think it says a lot that this book is set in Holland but the narrative is depressingly, exhaustingly similar to every other white-guy narrative in the US lit I've read.But whatever... I said I wasn't going to do character analysis. Like I said, I think setting this in a short story probably would have helped me, personally, enjoy it more--drawing this book out over a six or seven course meal felt like being stretched on the rack; I kept checking what page I was on and wondering how long it would take me to finish it. The narrative voice gets nagging and exhausting after only 30 pages or so. And much of the story has little to do with the story besides hammering home already-obvious points: the food/restaurant is pretentious and overpriced, the brother is self-absorbed and fake, the wife is his happy place and they are nearly telepathic, he is a monster who unwittingly taught his son how to be a monster. The most interesting parts where the parts where something actually happened (or the memory of something happening was told) in the story--where you find out what happened with the phone, where you find out what happened with the ATM booth, where the dad confronts his son, where you realize the mom sets up Beau's murder, etc. So much of the book existed just to set up the book.And the fact that none of it was resolved... I mean, maybe if I had enjoyed the novel more it would have been different (did anyone actually enjoy reading this?), but as it stands I started the novel exhausted and ended exhausted, and by the end of the novel nothing has changed--the boys committed a horrific act, they got away with it, and the parents helped them. The only thing that changed is that Serge, the politician with an actual moral compass (somehow, again, ironic) loses favor with the public and doesn't get the office he was running for. What did we gain from that?The book tries to sell itself as a book that "makes you question whether you actually know your kids" and "makes you wonder how far you'd go to protect your children" but, honestly, those questions are answered pretty quickly in the novel... Michel is just like his angry, explosive father, and his mother is complicit, and since they're horrible people to start, they go pretty damn far to protect and justify their kid.</text></scrape>
