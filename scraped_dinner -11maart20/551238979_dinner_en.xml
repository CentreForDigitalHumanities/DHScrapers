Gone Girl was fun, with hairpin twists and turns to the plot. This was not fun. This was just nasty. Like Gone Girl, this too has unreliable narrator, and characters making sharp bitchy observations. (view spoiler)[Their children are the spawns of Satan, and it's like reading about demons in a boardroom questioning the moralities and ethics about life and child-rearing. WTF? (hide spoiler)]The writing was good, the tension nicely paced -- it was a page turner alright. But it was ultimately unsatisfying--the violence was not sufficiently redeemed.</text></scrape>
