The sociopathic narrator, unreliable from the start, is a totally unpleasant mind to live inside throughout the novel. I hated him. Nasty, mean, paranoid, and violent. I wanted to do a cleanse after reading this book. Because we only have this one, sociopathic narrator, we have no idea about the true nature of the other characters which means we have 2-dimensional characterizations.That there are no neurological conditions (or very few, and they don't fit Paul's profile) that can be tested, makes the whole amniocentesis angle not credible. That Paul would still be walking the streets after beating a school principal almost to death is not credible. That Serge would have anything to do with his brother after his brother had beat his head in with a skillet is not credible. That Serge would allow his son to play with Michel after the vacation from hell, is not credible. That Clare would "glass" Serge AT THE RESTAURANT is not credible. This book is manipulative and sensational, cashing in on the era of sociopaths and helicopter parents.And as a reader, I felt manipulated. Of course, having a sociopathic narrator, one is going to feel manipulated. But I felt the author also set up situations, used plot devices that have no basis in reality, to manipulate the reader. Pissed me off. To think that this author actually spent some of his life depicting this excrement of humanity is mind-boggling. I read it because it was a Book Club book. All I can say, after reading it, is that was a day of my life that I will never get back.</text></scrape>
