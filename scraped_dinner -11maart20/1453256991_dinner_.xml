It's not every day you come across a book that is as well crafted as The Dinner. Herman Koch expertly crafts a story arc paced to the length of a dinner. Koch delivers small pieces with the aperitif and the appetizer, and finally gives us "the facts" with the main course. I appreciated the short time constraint of 2-3 hours of dinner to tell the story. It allowed Paul, the narrator, to delve into detail about social expectations, his thoughts on giving feedback on his wife's choice of earrings for the evening, and flashing back on the past. There is actually a lot less dialogue during the dinner than there is time spent in Paul's head.Paul is excellent. If I had to hear the story from any perspective, I'm glad I heard it from Paul. He was able to understand Michel, love Michel, protect Michel, but also feel scared of Michel. He was able to ponder the hereditary nature of father and son better than any of the other characters. We hear from Paul about different acts of violence Michel has seen him commit, and Paul was laughing or smiling in each account. The parallelism between father and son was subtle and not over the top. Koch has an amazing ability to beat around the bush and subtly drop hints about what's to come. He keeps you on your toes until the end of the novel. I loved how he refused to tell us which restaurant he was at, what disease he had, what the name of the school he taught at was, or how much the dinner cost. It's much better to let the reader imagine what it could be than to just show them what it is. People are comparing it Gone Girl and Girl on the Train- but this is 100x better. </text></scrape>
