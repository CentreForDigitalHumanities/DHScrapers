With the glowing reviews on the back cover from Gillian Flynn and SJ Watson I couldn't wait to read this book! First, I am not a fan of books that take place during a short period of time. I don't even like to think of listening to my own daily rambling thoughts let alone read about someone else's for an entire novel. Just get ON with it already! I hated every character in this book, which for me doesn't automatically mean I won't like a book-except in this case. These people are just reprehensible and icky. I don't know much about Amsterdam either, but I guess there you can assault a principal in a school to the point of hospitalization and you don't have to worry about punishment! You can smash your brother's face in with a hot saucepan and all is forgotten. Did I miss something? Am I can imbecile? Very disappointed.</text></scrape>
