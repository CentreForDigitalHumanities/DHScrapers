I understood the main storyline of a group of parents recognizing their children in security footage aired on the news of a violent act and each of the families processing what this means in terms of past/present/future. However, there were just so many words. I feel this could have been a short-story and I'm sure this is just because I didn't capture the book in its entirety. I found a message board that discussed this book and many readers seemed to view this as a story told through the POV of an unreliable/sociopathic narrator. This is a case when I wish I had actually read reviews and researched this book beforehand so I could have read into the story deeper than just this superficial, 1st-run audiobook experience. I don't plan to read it again though. It is being adapted to film which I do plan to watch if for no other reason than try to gain more insight into a story that may very well have been lost on me.If interested, click on THIS YOUTUBE LINK for a look at the movie trailer. The film is set to release in May 2017 starring Richard Gere, Rebecca Hall, Laura Linney, Steve Coogan, and Chloë Sevigny. Do you plan to watch it?My favorite quote:“Sometimes things come out of your mouth that you regret later on. Or no, not regret. You say something so razor-sharp that the person you say it to carries it around with them for the rest of their life.”Note: I removed my rating because I just don't feel right rating a book that I didn't grasp. If I was forced, I'd give it 2 stars but I have this lingering thought that I missed a very important element. It's like rating a book you DNF - if you didn't finish, how do you truly know what your rating would've been? Don't be mad. Just my opinion :)</text></scrape>
