There I was cruising through this book thinking it was nothing special until just less than halfway through...then it really got my attention. Clever, very clever - lull me into comfort then hit me with a big stick.As the book unfolds there are some simply sublime, dark and slightly terrifying moments mixed in with humour to try to ease the blow at times. I was feeling so many emotions by the end of the book. I didn't expect that much when I got this book after reading some pretty scathing past reviews but it's a very clever work. How it is compared to Gone Girl is beyond me, the two books couldn't be more different. I liked this slightly disturbing book, I like it when I don't see things coming and the book wins me over.Very, very clever, somewhat chilling and I think I had moments of holding my breath. This is one that messes with your head and you'll possibly either love it or hate it.Extremely character focused and interesting ones at that. The Dinner raises questions that are interesting to answer. A good one for book club reads due to discussion options. I really liked it a lot! 4 stars!I read my own paperback copy of this novel that I have owned for some time.</text></scrape>
