Or it may have made this already disturbing novel even more powerful. In trying to figure out what I think about this book after finishing it, I read several reviews online, and I think the New York Times review hits the trouble American audiences have with disturbing stories on the dot: we do not like reading about unlikeable people. We want narrators we can relate to. We want stories that make us feel safe, comfortable, and happy. The Dinner does none of these things. It is dark and twisted, and as the story unfolds (I really do not want to give away too much about the plot), Herman Koch's novel sucks readers in and makes them really feel the ugliness of humanity. There are only a few people I might recommend this to, and I disagree with the quote suggesting The Dinner is a European Gone Girl - both are addicting reads about sick people, but Gone Girl had an element of fiction, a suspension of disbelief, that this novel does not contain. I'm left with a nervous cramping in my stomach after reading this, but I acknowledge that means Koch did his job as a novelist well. </text></scrape>
