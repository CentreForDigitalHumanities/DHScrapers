There's that fear that someone will cock their head to one side and 'see' me in a different light.

That I might actually be a Tyler Durden hiding behind the supporting mom facade.

That I might actually have scored really high on the The Hare Psychopathy Checklist.

Someone might see what I'm actually thinking during that moment of road rage where my knuckles turn white and my jaw clenches and I start to laugh and laugh and laugh....

Or maybe not.</text></scrape>
