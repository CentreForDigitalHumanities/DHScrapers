Do characters have to be "nice" for a book to be "good"? Do you have to have something in common with the characters for them to feel "relatable"?I do understand, therefore, why some didn't care for this book, but it is undeniably well written. And for that, I give it four stars. Several things bothered Me about this novel, however. First, it felt a bit contrived. Additionally, the unreliable narrator tended to wander (a necessary mechanism for filling in why certain things happened, or why certain characters were who they were) so often and for such long stretches that it became tiresome, and after a hundred and fifty or so pages of that I no longer really cared much when he got back "on point". Lastly, it was a trifle predictable, but strained with the effort to appear not to be. The comparison to "Gone Girl" is inevitable, I guess. Calling it "The European Gone Girl", I suppose, excuses it for not being nearly as clever?Don't go into this thinking you're getting the literary thrill ride of a "Gone Girl", however. You'll be disappointed. This is not so much "Gone Girl" as it is "We Need To Talk About Michel".</text></scrape>
