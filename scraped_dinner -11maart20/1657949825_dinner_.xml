Paul obviously does not much like Serge, who is running to become prime minister of the Netherlands. The polls have Serge as the likely winner. When they and their wives meet at a posh restaurant one evening to discuss something, their lives will never be the same as secrets come to the fore. I had no expectations about this book, as I hadn't heard of it until we were to read it for my f2f book club. It took a bit to get going (and the food descriptions really didn't do anything for me), but about half-way through, once we found out why they had all met for dinner, it got interesting! It certainly kept me wanting to read. I have to admit to not liking the ending (or maybe just not agreeing that that's how it should have ended?), but that second half really held my interest and brought up my rating (except for the end).</text></scrape>
