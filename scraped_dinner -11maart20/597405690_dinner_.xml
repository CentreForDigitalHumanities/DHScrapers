I don't think this is my kind of book.I felt deflated after having spent all the time listening to it. The story itself drones on at points and feels like it is never going to end and then (since I hate to not finish a book), I got to the end, all I felt was confusion.With all the little details in this book, there were so many times that I had absoultely no idea what was happening. The ending......not much I can say other than confusion.I feel bad giving any book a poor star rating, but this book definitely was not my style.</text></scrape>
