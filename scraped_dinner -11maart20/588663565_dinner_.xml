This has been described as "A European Gone Girl." I loved Gone Girl, but the only thing I think that's similar is that both books are full of horrible, selfish people. The Dinner was just plain boring and I found the pacing not well done. I've read some interesting theories about The Dinner, but I'm not quite sure about them, and they certainly don't change the fact that I was bored throughout. </text></scrape>
