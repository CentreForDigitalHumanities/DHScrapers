After discussing the book at book club last night, I decided to up the rating, solely based on the fact that the author did (a) keep my interest until the end and (b) evoked strong feelings from me regarding the characters. WARNING: There could be parts of this review that are considered spoilers. DO NOT READ if you haven't read the book yet. Know this- I didn't enjoy it.This book aggravated the crap out of me. I didn't like the writing style, or should I say I didn't like the procession of the story. It bounced around in a way that was like watching a homemade video, making you a little dizzy. But more than that, I despised the narrator, almost from the beginning. His aggression was so evident, from the get go, it was incredibly disturbing. His jealousy, his violence - all just awful. And how the heck did Claire LOVE this man? This angry, whacked out, quick to snap man who could smash people's faces in out of anger??? In fact, there wasn't much about any of the characters that was endearing or even likeable. But the thing I found MOST disturbing about the whole book was how Paul and Claire could ever justify what the boys did, putting the blame on the victim? I'm not saying a parent wouldn't go to extreme ends to protect a child, maybe help them hide the truth or help them out, but that justification angle was just too much. </text></scrape>
