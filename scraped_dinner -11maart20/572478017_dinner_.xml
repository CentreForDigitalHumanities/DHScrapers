Goodreads, you're killing me with the lack of half-stars here!I thought the writing was incredible. In some places, it is so, so sharp--there is not an extra word in there anywhere, as my friend Becky said. In other places it meanders a bit, but I thought it was interesting how the meandering kind of lulled you into feeling a little bored and secure, and then BAM, you realize that Paul is completely batshit crazy--and that Claire is possibly even more so--and it's really very chilling.No, not a single character is likable, although I think Serge probably isn't as terrible as Paul makes him seem. Serge, it seems, at least wants to attempt to do the right thing. Paul and Claire are possibly the two most terrifying sociopaths I have encountered. *shudder*One thing that did bother me: the amniocentesis thing. I'm pretty sure you cannot screen for violent tendencies. I couldn't decide if the author was asking us to take a big suspension of disbelief, or if he was illustrating the extent to which Paul will lie lie lie lie lie to shift the blame away from himself and his parenting, for the way Michel turned out.I know some of my friends have verrrrry strong negative opinions about this book, but I liked it. It was very different from what I usually read and it was kind of fun, watching the insanity unfold. Three and a half stars, Goodreads ratings be damned! :)</text></scrape>
