This book was the biggest eye roll I've ever read. Do people truly think this way? I recognize the need to protect family, especially children, no matter what they've done. But these parents continue to justify in the most absurd and unbelievable ways what their sons had done. The narrator also repeatedly hints at things to get you interested, but then never touches on them. But really all they add is irritation that the narrator thinks he's more intelligent than the reader (which, I can assure you he's not). And the story itself was so disappointing. I could probably write a novella explaining that (which I won't waste my time doing).The book was a very quick read, which is the only reason I finished it (it only took me a couple hours). But honestly, I find it laughable that it receives any praise at all. </text></scrape>
