Well I was indeed mortified. Let me just start from the beginning because the title says it all, they are having a nice civil dinner. Literally nothing interesting for the next 120 pages, I was ready to put the book down, but honestly I despise how a person can say they didn't like a particular book without reading the whole thing so I trudged through it. Next we find out the son killed a homeless person and beats homeless people up for fun. Then as the book progresses we see it switch from a dinner setting and now he's a teacher in Germany with no warning that this was a flashback and not indeed actually happening during that very moment, then Paul gets fired. Surprise, surprise they are now back eating dinner again and Paul continually has these flashbacks with no warning what so ever. At the very end it seems as if the son is actually beating these people to please his dad because when the son does beat these people his dad laughs. That's horrid. I may have somehow missed a deeper meaning behind this book but I would not recommend this book to anyone of any age who liked any particular genre.</text></scrape>
