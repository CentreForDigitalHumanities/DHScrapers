Why did Michael's dad pay the restaurant manager never to tell anyone that he saw Michael and his dad outside, then go home and delete the phone message his wife left on the answering machine as an alibi for Michael? That seems illogical and contradictory What was the mystery diagnosis for which Michael's "poor old dad" was non-compliant with his medication? And Michael's mom...what meds should she be on after bashing her brother-in-law in the head? Perhaps her husband isn't the only one with an illness, undiagnosed or at least not referred to by the author. And what happened in the end to the black-mailing adopted cousin? Another murder or just a head-bashing? Ah yes, the "happy family"!Allusions to possible hereditary mental illness, criminal behavior and personality traits abound, but are undefined and unsubstantiated. Maybe my fellow book club members will enlighten me, one rated this 3 stars, but I'm changing my rating from 2 to 1.Oh and to be picky, and perhaps absurdly critical, why is there a lobster dinner on the cover? I don't remember anyone ordering that dish. I take cover art very seriously and believe that the artist/designer should read the book to make the cover relevant to the text.</text></scrape>
