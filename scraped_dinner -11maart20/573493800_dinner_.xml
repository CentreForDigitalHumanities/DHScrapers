Dinner, with a little family history thrown in. Each of the characters are despicable. At first, you think they are a normal family, dysfunctional; but normal. It is only later that you find out how truly damaged they all are. The story is horrible, the whole reason for them being at dinner that evening. It is worrisome, because you know there are people like this in your own family, your neighborhood, part of your community and in the world. How many things go undiscovered, because of the actions of a few people. I won't go any further, without giving anything away. Read this at your own risk; and not because of horrible writing, but because of the characters. There was no one to root for in this novel. Good luck</text></scrape>
