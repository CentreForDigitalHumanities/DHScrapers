I just do not know. Anyway. . .) Like these other three books, a father reminisces about a crime his son has committed and whether his parenting had any role in it. UNLIKE these other three books, however, it was written suggesting so clearly that the father DID have a role in it (the father has either an anger problem or some other type of mood disorder, and there are flashbacks to certain times in the boy’s childhood where the father clearly steered the son in the wrong direction), that it just wasn’t that chilling to me as a reader and as a parent. There was no, “Gee, if this could happen to this father, it could happen to anybody!” Rather, it was like, “This is so heavy-handed and the father is clearly wrong wrong wrong, no wonder this kid got messed up.” I just didn’t feel the accolades that everyone else seems to have given to this book and this author. Shrug. By the end, I almost wanted to laugh, it was so ridiculous and over-the-top. Lastly, it loses points for lack of originality; the three books I mentioned above all did this “genre” better, in my humble opinion. </text></scrape>
