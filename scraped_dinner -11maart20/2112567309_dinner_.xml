Honestly it was engaging, engrossing and all that - but I hated everyone, especially Paul - he just seemed so petty to me. His wife Claire was the real MVP in this novel, she was definitely the one to watch. It's so interesting how she came through when situations arose. She was definitely my favourite character in the novel. Overall, The Dinner was pretty twisted and illustrated the amount of privilege white kids and white people have and the amount of crazy shit they can get away with. This fact is why I gave this novel three stars. It was well written but when you see these situations on television and see how white kids' parents interject into awful situations and cause an even bigger and more dangerous shit storm (for example: Google Brock Turner and subsequently Brock Turner's dad) you really can't get that much of a kick out of reading a fiction novel about more white people being murderous assholes and pinning the blame on the random black kid they eventually made "disappear". </text></scrape>
