As each course is presented the reader comes to realize that each person at the table has their own agenda, their own secrets and that this is in no way a loving family nor a fun night out on the town! This story unfolds much like a 5 course meal, cocktails and small talk, a sampling of this, a taste of that and casual conversation, the main course where true thoughts and personalities come out and of course the final flourish of desert and the decision of whether the evening was a success. (for me it was not, for a few of the characters I suppose it was!) The common bond, other than relation is that they each have a son, and these two young boys have committed a horrible act. Each parent has their own ideas on the way in which the act and the "children" should be dealt with. This is the true reason for the little get together though each one at the table has already decided what to do and they are unlikely to change their minds. I must say that these characters presented as rather normal at first but they were far from that. By the end of the book I so disliked them all, found them selfish, bigoted and pretty disturbing, and had no sympathy for any of them. It is no wonder their children were so horrid! The narrator is so unreliable that I could not figure out whether to believe half of what I was reading. He left out enough information that you were left dangling a few times. And the ending left me wondering what had just happened!! Rather hard to swallow.....yet, I kept turning pages to see if anyone would redeem themselves. This is a dark (jet black) and twisted (knots everywhere) tale, and I can not say I liked it....but it was so well done it will be a book I won't be able to forget any time soon. Questions regarding ethics and morals run throughout the book. Questions about how people perceive things. Questions about the face we show in public compared to who we are in private. Questions of what lengths would you go to for your child? Hard to believe this could happen (yet similar stories are in the news almost daily) this was a thrill ride with many a twists and turns.  A 4 star read for me despite the fact that I didn't like the characters nor the ending. This is a book that makes you think....about many things, about what would I do and I imagine it to be a popular book club read.....or perhaps great conversation at your next dinner!</text></scrape>
