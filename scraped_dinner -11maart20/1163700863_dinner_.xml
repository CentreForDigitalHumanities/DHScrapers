The. Fuck. That was so messed up and I don't even know what the point was. Based on my extensive psychological training through watching Criminal Minds, I have made the following diagnoses:Paul is a narcissistic psychopath with some unidentified genetic disorder. Michel is a psychopath with the same genetic disorder. Claire is a manipulative sociopath who likes her husband better when he's acting more psychopathy and she orchestrates the murder of her nephew. Babette is not mentally ill, but she cares more about her husband becoming prime minister than her son facing justice for killing someone. Serge is the least horrible person in this book even though Paul tries to make it seem like he's the worst. He actually has a conscience, but ultimately he doesn't follow through because, you know, Claire assaults him into silence. I don't know enough about Rick and Beau to make an assessment. They might just be idiot boys with questionable morals or they might be worse. That's all I have to say. </text></scrape>
