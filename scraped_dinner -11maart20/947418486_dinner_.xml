And the middle part, during the main course, this book was really a pageturner but at the end I didn't see the point of this book. I don't understand what Herman Koch wanted with this novel. I also think the writing style isn't for me at all. The short and not revealing style that this is written in pretty much bugged me the whole way through the book. Specially at the end when I realized that many of the questions I had would go unanswered, which for be felt way to confusing of why Koch had to do that. I know that the characters aren't supposed to be likable, or at least I expect them not to be, because I couldn't care for anyone of them. Paul, the narrator of this story probably annoyed me the most. None of the characters where in, for me, someone you could relate to.I thought before starting this book that I would like it, being that this book is liked by many of my collages liked it. I'm awfully glad this was a book club book because I felt a strong need to talk about once I finished but that didn't mean I liked it.At the beginning, when they all sit down for dinner I really think Koch did a great job showing the tension between these two couples. I found it unconformable to read even, but it made me wonder how this story would progress. As soon as I come to last part of the book I just couldn't anymore.. I just could buy this characters actions and the lack of consequences at the end. How they (at least Paul & Claire) are just too crazy to be believable. To conclude, I didn't like this book very much. I'm glad I got to discuss it after I finished it and I think it was a good choice for a book club book, being that there is so many things to talk about after reading this.I did read it quite fast, specially the middle part, and it wasn't hard to get through in any way just a book I kind of feel strangely about after having read it.That said, I would still, someday, try to read something else of Herman Koch. I just think this story was so not for me but I'm kind of curious of what other stories Koch has written. </text></scrape>
