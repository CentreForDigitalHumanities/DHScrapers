But as the book...and dinner...progressed, I felt I was being manipulated to accept increasingly implausible story lines. The most obvious "this would never happen" moment is, in fact, the entire premise of the bookâ€”that a deeply personal and horrific event would be discussed openly at a crowded restaurant where one of the lead characters is a figure of national prominence. The other "oh, come on!" moment involved the whole amniocentesis-being-able-to-identify-mental-illness angle. Maybe if this story had been set in the future and there was some new-fangled prenatal test that could pinpoint a specific mental illness gene...I would have been more satisfied. This was a very weak story angle in my eyes, and sadly, the entire crux of the book seemed to rest on it.I won't even go into how lame it was that Claire wounded Serge just so that he'd be too disfigured to give a press conference...and lo and behold, because the press conference never happened, Serge changed his mind about turning in the boys.I had been told by someone who recommended this book that the last page was a "stunner." If by "stunned," they meant "confused," I would agree. I don't believe that the author intended to leave us scratching our heads at the end...I honestly think that he believed he had wrapped things up and given us all an "aha!" moment. Even after re-reading the last chapter I was left with the weak feeling that I "sort of" got it. I interpreted the ending to be that Michel was a chip off the old block...as sociopathic as his dad. By that point, however, it hardly felt like an "aha!" moment. I'd been able to connect the dots much earlier and surmised that Paul (as well as his wife and kid) were a family of psychopaths.In the end, I felt that the author used too many gimmicks to try and beef up a weak story. The five-course (?) meal as a framework to tell this story was kind of cute at first but in time, it felt lazy...as did the repeated refusal to be more specific about the names of restaurants, people or health conditions. It felt like the easy way out.I will say that I devoured The Dinner in only 2 days. But it left me reaching for a bottle of Tums.</text></scrape>
