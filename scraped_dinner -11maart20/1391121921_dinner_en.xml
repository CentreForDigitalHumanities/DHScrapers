The Dinner  by Herman Koch was a strange book. But I like strange. This novel tackles a variety of topics, including the depths of family bondage, the pretentious niceties of social interaction, and, perhaps most notably, the disintegration of man when faced with unspeakable decisions. The majority of the characters were vile, despicable human beings, but (shockingly!) you might find yourself agreeing (or at least understanding) many of their decisions. The narrator gave off some  American Psycho/  Patrick Bateman vibes, which kept me at the edge of my seat, turning the pages with apt amusement. Is this book for everyone? Definitely not. It was odd and shocking and even vulgar at times. Yet as a reading experience? It was fun as hell. I will definitely be checking out more of Koch's work! </text></scrape>
