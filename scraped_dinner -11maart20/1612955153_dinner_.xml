When an author presents a story that is so brutal, so suspenseful, so infuriating, I think he owes the reader a little catharsis at the end. Koch vehemently denies the reader this catharsis. I appreciate the literary merit of this, and it’s probably more truthful to life. There is a lack of satisfaction in the “neat-as-a-bow, good guys get married, bad guys get punished” kind of ending, as well. However, this book left me with a bad taste in my mouth.</text></scrape>
