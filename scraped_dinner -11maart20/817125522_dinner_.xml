Loved (and loathed) this book. It was do good, but so diabolical. It absolutely sucked me in from the beginning, and made me feel I had a good grasp on the cast of characters and then, boom, flipped it entirely on the head. Unreliable narrators doesn't even really cover it, just complete skewering of expectations because ... When I think unreliable, I think purposefully misleading in order to garner sympathy. This goes beyond that, on every (appalling and yet compelling) level. But the best thing is how it messed with my understanding and expectations of the non-narrator characters. Just - yes.Enthralling, disturbing, *interesting* and fast-paced book.(and I am super glad I will never meet that family in real life!)</text></scrape>
