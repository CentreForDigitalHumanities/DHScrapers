It's like watching the first season of a Real Housewives franchise. You don't like any of the characters but you just keep watching hoping that maybe, eventually, it gets better. It doesn't. None of the characters are even a little relatable, I hated every single one of them. They had no depth, no personality, they were all flat and useless. I'm not even tagging this for spoilers because no one should ever read this book. The plot itself is shit. Why would you go to a fancy restaurant where everyone knows you to talk about the murder your kids committed? And then proceed to cause a scene with your crying wife. The fact that Claire got Serge to change his mind was by attacking him with a broken wine glass is the most idiotic thing about the book. And I get that we're not supposed to know what happened to Beau because ooo it's a mystery but I actually don't care I'm just annoyed. Paul (the narrator) is by far the most annoying character. He intentionally leaves gaps in the story like: my wife was being operated on (but I won't tell you for what) at a hospital (but I won't tell you which one). Or we ate a restaurant (but I won't tell you its name). Or she asked what time it was and she told her (but I won't tell you). Or I worked at ___ school before I was fired (but I won't tell you). Or I have a mental illness (but you can't know what!!!) Like listen dude, a) I didn't ask and b) you not telling me doesn't make your story more mysterious or interesting. It just makes it annoying. This book also comes off as ableist af. Paul excuses his attitude and his general being a sick fuck with his mysterious mental illness and he talks about how he should have aborted his son because he likely has "it" too. I'm sorry but not labeling the mental illness to avoid sounding ableist is still ableist. It makes all mentally ill people seem like sick fucks who go off their meds and do shit like Paul. Koch dances around this mental illness portraying Paul as the sickest of sick fucks who constantly fantasizes about killing and hurting people and then laughs about it which is really unsettling but maybe that's the point. Who knows. The writing is awful. The metaphors and descriptions the authors uses are odd. It could be because the original was written in Dutch but I still don't understand why you would translate it word for word if it didn't make sense contextually. Just overall a hideous book. Don't bother. Total waste of time.</text></scrape>
