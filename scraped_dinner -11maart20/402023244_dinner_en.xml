It has been compared with Shriver’s ‘We Need to Talk about Kevin’ and ‘The Slap’ amongst others but it most reminded me of ‘Gone Girl’ for the kicker in the plot narration, and elements of the recent Russian film “Elena” or the films of Michael Haneke. The reviewer in The Telegraph thought “A more illuminating comparison, however, might be with Michel Houellebecq, and not simply because Koch’s affectless prose and misanthropic narrator echo the Frenchman’s best work. For Houellebecq, you sense, would have avoided the temptation to demystify the family’s sociopathic behaviour. He, surely, would have just let it hang there, unexplained, like a Rorschach blot onto which we could project our own interpretations…This slight recalibration could have stopped this being Paul’s problem and made it the Netherlands’ problem. Europe’s problem. Everyone’s problem. And that, you feel, would have made for a genuinely disturbing read.” http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/bo...I loved the comments on petit-bourgeois life, on sibling rivalry, on middle-class values and the depiction of political life in The Netherlands where this book is set. It’s a clever piece of work. I’d like to say some more things, about the narrator in particular, but this would lead to plot spoilers. </text></scrape>
