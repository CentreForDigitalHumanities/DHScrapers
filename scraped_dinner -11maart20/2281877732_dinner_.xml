Reading this book was a unique experience because it allowed me to relate to and sympathize with the narrator, Paul, that I later came to dislike, including twists in how I perceived secondary characters like Paul’s wife Claire. Herman Koch wrote this book in such a way that the characters who are overall normal and somewhat reasonable are disliked by readers at first, because of the way Paul describes them. Because of this, I finished this book thinking about how differently each person experiences their own reality. The way that each of the characters reacted to the emergency showed what they believed the most important effect of it was. This has caused me to start evaluating situations that I’m in through the perspective of the other people involved to explain why they do what they do. In addition to this, The Dinner was a short read because the anticipation of the secret and how Paul’s past plays into the handling of the situation kept me invested, even through the fact that I disliked a lot of characters themselves. The plot alone was enough to bring me to the end of the book. It is difficult to recommend this book because the characters become unlikeable quickly, yet it has the potential to be an interesting experience for anyone looking for a book that is out of the ordinary with plot twists and the anticipation of a secret. </text></scrape>
