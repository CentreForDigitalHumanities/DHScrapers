I sure don't believe that I would do what these stupid people did. To start with all of the characters were so loathsome that it actually made the story rather unpalatable...to continue on the dinner theme. I can't believe these adults actually reacted the way they did to what these kids did. These little 15 year old "angels" saw nothing wrong...and had no remorse what so ever...except they got caught on camera...with setting fire to a homeless woman for the "fun" of it just to see what would happen. I don' see how these parents could possibly eat dinner after viewing this. The one interesting "twist" that got this 3 stars instead of 2...was that one of the fathers turned out to show some common sense. He actually wanted to take some sort of action to the situation...while the other one was actually a psychopath whose "little apple" didn't fall far from the tree. I will say I don't believe I've ever read anything quiet like it... and I have read some gruesome ones.</text></scrape>
