I kept telling myself it was probably the translation which made the sentences seem choppy at times, or maybe in Dutch they manage to keep readers' attention and interest longer. In any case, I was inattentive from the start, caring little for the characters and even less for what they ordered for dinner, not to mention the frivolous bickering between them.The premise seemed interesting: two couples meet at a restaurant to discuss a heinous crime, and how their children were involved in it. Each chapter of the story begins with the courses ordered during the dinner. We learn about a hereditary illness, which is not clearly defined, as are many other details which could have been interesting to learn. I wonder if the author was simply too lazy to do the necessary research...? One of the children involved is an adopted child from Burkina Faso, but his origin and race, and all we learn about him, seem ultimately irrelevant to the plot. And then there's the fact that the very delicate subject they meant to discuss was left until the end of the meal, which seems unlikely.On a positive note, it made me wonder what I, as a mother, would do in a similar situation, and how far I would go to protect my children. And, should I decide to abet my children and help cover their tracks, what could I do to save their souls? Although the plot provokes interesting questions, its execution was so weak it doomed the book for me.</text></scrape>
