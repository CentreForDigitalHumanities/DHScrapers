I liked the structure and it kept me turning pages, but I really wasn't expecting it to fall under the genre of horror, which it kinda did. The narrator starts off as unlikable, then moves to crazy town and pretty soon everyone else follows. I just couldn't buy in to everyone being so deranged. The ending didn't feel plausible. I think Defending Jacob did it better, but still a quick and intriguing read.</text></scrape>
