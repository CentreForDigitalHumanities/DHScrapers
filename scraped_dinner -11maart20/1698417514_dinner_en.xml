I've read some twisted stuff in my day, but this one is near the top of the list.. When I finished it I litteraly could not stop asking myself (out loud) "What the.... WHAT?!?!" Not your "typical-gory-horror-story" yarn, but a seemingly normal tale of a family and their "issues" that slowly becomes more creepy & phycologically warped as the pages keep turning, making it that much more effective.  This whole jarring story takes place over a five course meal at a hip new fine dining restaurant, and as a result (trust me on this one folks) you may never want to eat out again..:) Runoutandgetyousomemang</text></scrape>
