Alderson</author><rating>it was amazing</rating><text>I have read many wonderful books during the last five years, yet Het Diner by Herman Koch has probably stayed with me the longest. This is one of the most surprising and captivating books I’ve ever read. You will not guess what happens next, I almost guarantee it! It’s extraordinary well written but more importantly, well-conceived. I can’t say much about it without ruining the plot, except buy it, you won’t be disappointed. It is rather dark; cozy readers may be shocked by the story's resolution.</text></scrape>
