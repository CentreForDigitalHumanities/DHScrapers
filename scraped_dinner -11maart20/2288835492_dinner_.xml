Seriously. I think this is the kind of story that people will either like or not and reading anything could reduce the power of Koch’s writing. In my humble opinion, there are many readers who think and express their opinions that translations are something to be avoided. So, don't read on. Go read the Koch's book.I found "The Dinner" a bit of genre in a literary read that comprises familiarity and an undemanding/compelling plot.Koch successfully led me gently through the opening, which is narrated by a boorish, would-be bohemian who believes himself a decent human (even after my trust was long gone), into some darker territory. Suddenly, the author propelled me forward with a cast of unsympathetic and angry characters and thrust interest in my face until I couldn’t stop reading, wanting to find the consequences of the sudden… No, the startling outbursts of violence. What are the repercussions to violence? I had to know.If you’re looking for a tale of morality or poetic justice, then this isn’t the book — nobody here gets his/her just deserts. So, you answer that with your thoughts that were all concealing some blackness in our hearts that we don’t reveal via any outward appearance of being reasonable, then maybe you’ll like The Dinner; it just might confirm your cynicism.Seems Paul Lohman is stunned when he realizes he has a real problem. His teen son, Michel, did something bad—really, really bad. But, that’s not the worst of the stunning news he’s getting because he’s watching a video of what his son’s did on the evening new…along with the rest of the “horrified” nation. The images might be too grainy for anyone to identify the culprits. Well, not for Paul. He knows who it is. Michel and his cousin, Rick.BUT, there is an additional shock for the reader because Rick’s dad, Serge, is Paul’s older brother, and a sibling he detests…and Serge is also a politician. Not just any old politician. According to poll results, it seems Serge is going to be the next prime minister of the Netherlands.I don't want to say anything more... more could be too much and I hope you'll read this book.</text></scrape>
