The author is Dutch and the translation is clear; I was never aware of the fact that it was originally written in a language other than English. The entire story takes place in a restaurant, with a dialogue among two brothers and their wives, but there are flashbacks which flesh out the story and build the suspense. I really liked the voice of the narrator and the style of writing. (I can’t help but contrast this to The Silent Wife, whose narrator bugged me and thus made the story tedious rather than intriguing—makes me realize how you must like the narrator’s voice if the book is to work.) In The Dinner, the narrator is smart, sympathetic, chatty, interesting, and real—and he keeps dropping bombshells. It’s always fun when you have a narrator who gets you hooked on his likeability and then casually reveals disturbing things about himself. It’s easier to forgive someone who is likeable, which sort of puts you in a moral quandary. It takes a while to learn the purpose of the dinner, but I got totally sucked into the narrator’s story, so the pace didn’t annoy me. Highly recommend. </text></scrape>
