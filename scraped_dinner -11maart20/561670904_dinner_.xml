The story is told via courses of the meal. It's from the perspective of Paul, the brother who begins with hilarious observations of pretentiousness and meals in outrageously prices restaurants. His brother, Serge, is a political figure who is on track to be Hollands next prime minister. As the story unfolds, we learn about the narrator, who has severe emotional issues (rage). We learn that his son has most likely inherited said problems. We learn that the two boys were involved with a murder of a homeless woman which has been videoed and placed on UTube. Whats more, we learn that the parents want to keep their boys identity anonymous, excusing the boys of youthful indiscretion. It's brilliantly paced. To me, it was mesmerizingâ€¦.how people can explain away, rationalize inherent issues with their children. For me, it was shocking, disturbing, yet believable. I loved it. I've always wondered how people can not make their children be responsible when facts are glaring in their faces. Koch is an excellent writer.</text></scrape>
