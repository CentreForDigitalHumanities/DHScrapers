When will you learn that if you commit a crime it is generally not advisable to videotape it and put it on the internet? I just do not understand this mentality. Do you want to get caught? In The Dinner, the sons of both couples have a son who beat up a defenseless homeless woman and put the video on YouTube. Awesome, how cool is that?Four points I found outlandish:1) One of the sons who committed the heinous act in order to act tough in front of his peers repeatedly calls his mother “momma” like a 3 year old. LOL.2) Pretentious European upper class couple weighing judgment on others has a son who committed outrageous act. Maybe you should be more concerned with the activities of your teenager than with looking down at others.3) Going to eat dinner at a posh restaurant and continually making scenes about such delicate issues. Wouldn’t it be wiser to be in a private place? Do not forget that one member of the party is destined to be the future Prime Minister of Holland.4) The pacing was awful. The first half is filled with trivial matters and shallow conservations. Quite tedious and boring to say the least.The characters in The Dinner are all morally bankrupt and not in a good way. Rather than being concerned about the act itself, the parents remain consumed about how it will damage their reputation and hurt their son. Then there is the whole subplot of the death penalty that appeared out of nowhere and did not fit at all. What was the point of that? Through it all we learn that the father is just as bad as the son. LOL, my ardent reactions are even making me chuckle. I did not realize how much I hated this book until I started writing the review. Originally I was going to rate it 2 stars but now it is 1 star.</text></scrape>
