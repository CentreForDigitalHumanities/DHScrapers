Turns out I didn't find it to be dreadful. There are some great nuances and observations about the human psyche that I enjoyed. But ultimately it's a frustrating story, with way more than its share of ambiguities and unanswered questions. If you prefer things to be black and white, this isn't the book for you.</text></scrape>
