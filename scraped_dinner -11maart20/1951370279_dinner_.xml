A co-worker of mine forced it into my hands so I had no choice: this is one I had to read. Though I didn't know much about it going in, it pretty much read how I thought it would. It was a fast read, and though I was unsure whether I would end up liking it the end sealed it for me. Reading it made me think of Next Life Might Be Kinder by Howard Norman or A Certain Matter by Kenzaburo Oe. The ending so much made me think of The Heart Keeper by Francoise Sagan, one of the best books I've read this year and now on my favorites shelf. Except her book is short, weird, funny as well.But overall, a good read. I probably won't ever revisit it, but I enjoyed it.</text></scrape>
