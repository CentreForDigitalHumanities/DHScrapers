These characters are written to be unlikeable. That's the way you're supposed to view them. No one in their right mind would respect these people for the way they're handling the situation. Unlikeable characters doesn't equal bad book. Imagine you wrote a book with a main character you absolutely loathe and people were writing reviews saying "Awful book! I hated the main character! Don't read it! Badly written!" (obviously in a more sophisticated manner, but you understand what I mean)I understand if you don't enjoy reading the book because of it, but that doesn't make it a bad book. I am so tired of people saying things like that. Just because it's not your cup of tea, doesn't mean it can't be somebody elses or shouldn't be somebody elses. Before you judge a book, please think about whether you simply didn't enjoy this book or if it was actually bad. Thank you.</text></scrape>
