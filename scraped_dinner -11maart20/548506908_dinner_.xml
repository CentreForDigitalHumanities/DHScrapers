It seems a little too...public, for me. Plus, please, somebody tell me what this magical behavioral disorder is that you can detect in amniotic fluid. Because as far as I'm aware, you can't tell those kinds of things from an amniocentesis. It's as ridiculous as getting that test and finding out that your future kid is going to be good at math, or love the color green, or hate Celine Dion.I was also confused about the kicker at the end. Earlier in the book, the son actually tells his dad that he is being blackmailed and then, the big climax, the mom tells the dad,  oh, btdubs, our son is being blackmailed  and the dad is absolutely shocked (see, and it's not even a spoiler that I just straight up said it just now with no spoiler tag because it's NOT A SPOILER IN THE BOOK) I don't understand why it was so shocking.Anyway, this book just didn't work for me and that's, like, five hours of my life that I'll never get back.</text></scrape>
