The characters were horrible, and the writing was stilted and disconnected in places. I've read many reviews saying that perhaps this was due to the English translation. I read it all the way through hoping my distaste for the book would eventually change. Unfortunately it did not. Just wish I would've checked this one out of the library rather than spend my money on it.</text></scrape>
