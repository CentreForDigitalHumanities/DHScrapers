It was engaging and painted a very clear picture of the strained relationship between two brothers. There was a way in which the author didn't overtly share all the information that I wanted to know as a reader, so it kept me reading to see if I could find out more. However, after a certain point, that was rather frustrating. A similar pattern of not sharing things that most readers would "want" to know continued through out. The characters also took a major turn at a certain point and people that I thought I liked, I found out that I did not really like them at all. I find the moral questions of the book disturbing - at least how they were handled by the characters in the book. Not being a parent just yet, I'm sure that the situation warrants hesitation on the part of a parent, but the overall conclusions reached by the characters were bothersome to me on many levels. This wasn't a book that took me long to get through, but overall, it left a bad taste in my mouth that would make me hesitate to recommend it to others. </text></scrape>
