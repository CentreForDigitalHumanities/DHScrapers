"The Dinner" is an exception because I thought it was OK until page 184, where it lost all credibility. Sometimes it is interesting for an author to create characters who view the world through the distorted lenses of their stereotypical beliefs. However, It is disheartening and disturbing when an author bases an entire novel on his own unexamined assumptions. Koch hasn't done the work required of a good novelist, but has resorted to cheap stereotypes with a little science fiction thrown in. **Partial Spoiler (ending is not revealed)**The narrator, a middle aged man who lacks empathy and has problems with uncontrolled anger, is diagnosed with a syndrome with a "German sounding name. It was the surname of the neurologist who'd had this particular disorder named after him." This mysterious syndrome, which Koch coyly doesn't name is primarily a "neurological matter" which causes trouble in social situations and sensitivity to stimuli. I knew immediately that Koch was insinuating that the character had a trumped-up version of Asperger's Syndrome (named after Hans Asperger). (When the novel was written, it was still a diagnosable condition. Now it is rolled under the autism spectrum umbrella. ) The psychologist goes on to state that this serious syndrome can be effectively treated with a pill and sunglasses to block out stimuli. Furthermore, it can be detected in an amnio and parents might consider terminating a pregnancy. Huh? Perhaps the author was being humorous and ironic? Was he really trying to blame the narrator's problems on autism? With a made-up DNA test? That can be cured with a magic pill? So far there was nothing about the narrator (or his son) that indicated even remotely an autism diagnosis. I stopped then and did a Google search. Here is what Koch said in an interview when asked what the narrator's diagnosis was: “I was deliberately vague about that. I considered certain autistic disorders, particularly Asperger’s. After all, he is rather indifferent about what happens to other people. But if I had stated this explicitly in the book, people would have said, ‘That’s a very crude caricature, people with Asperger’s don’t behave as aggressively and unpredictably as this fictional character!’ I had no wish to engage in discussions of that kind. However, I did consult an expert about whether someone’s DNA might show clear evidence of such disorders. He told me that this is not yet possible, but that it will be in five years’ time. So that’s the only bit of science fiction in the whole book.”So Koch basically created, in his own words, a crude caricature with science fiction thrown in. It goes without saying that the rest of the book devolves into a steaming pile of bull****. Nothing makes sense when all reality is stripped from a so-called realistic contemporary novel.</text></scrape>
