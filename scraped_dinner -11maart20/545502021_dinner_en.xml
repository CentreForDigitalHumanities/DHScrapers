After we talked about it a bit, I knew I wanted to read it hot off the press. 2/12/13: Cheers! Dinner begins...2/24/13: Wow. Just finished. Now I'm reading review comparisons to Gone Girl. Hmmmm....maybe? In a claustrophobic, restaurant enclosed setting. There are similarities in the nasty people involved in both books. But no matter, it's a great read and uniquely it's own! Nothing more can be said without spoiling. Bon appetit!</text></scrape>
