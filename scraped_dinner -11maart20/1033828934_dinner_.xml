However, it sounded similar so I kept it there and bought it when the price came down.I looked briefly at reviews before starting it and they were pretty dire.....so I was a little apprehensive. However, I quite enjoyed it despite the fact I abhorred the characters in it and the way they behaved. The only one with any redeeming features at all was Serge for me, the one you least expected to be the most likeable.A lot of things they said and did left my jaw hitting the floor. I'm not a parent but have to wonder just how far some parents will go when it comes to their offspring, whether in the right or wrong.I found the writing style VERY hard-going in places but the book does provoke some emotion for sure.I didn't like the translator chose to opt for American spellings till I read he's an American. Didn't expect that in a European-based story. There were dropped speechmarks I spotted and the use of the word jovial when I think genial was meant but by far my biggest annoyance was the repetitiveness of some lines....like this: .."as a diner in need of privacy to that of nationally known face: a nationally known face that..." or "....I had been there more often, more often than I liked" or "regret you feel when you miss a tennis ball: you were planning to smash it, but you swing hard and miss..". WHY would someone write this way ? It cropped up more times than I've illustrated here and was very, very irritating. With all the words available in the English language why keep using the same ones ?? I would try another book by him but won't bother any more if he writes like this all the time. It was lucky in this case that I needed to know what happened so stuck with it. The story was a good one.</text></scrape>
