I've been trying to use the library for most Nook reading, instead of just doing the easy 2-click purchase, but the wait for those is long. Worse, sometimes I don't get the notification and I lose my window for downloading a library copy. That level of frustration is just what the publishers want, of course; it drives us to buy their books. The Nook is great for travel, though, much better than lugging 4 or 5 books in my luggage or carry-on.This is a compelling book to read. Once I started it, I finished in about 3 sittings. It's all too easy to picture myself in these parents' dilemma. Their honesty about who they and their children are, and what they'll do to shield them from the consequences of their actions, is chilling. The author makes fun of some upper-middle-class habits and obsessions, but the most shattering is the revelation of a two-tiered justice system where juveniles with influential parents can have lives that aren't necessarily ruined by a youthful error in judgment.</text></scrape>
