The son of each couple has committed a crime. The boys have not yet been identified by the authorities, but their images on CCTV have been televised to a shocked audience. To report their children or not, this is the question.As this book progresses, which, because of the short time frame covered, the few characters and the limited sets, feels like at a snail’s pace, there are many more issues up for discussion. The high public profile of one of the brothers leaves him most at risk from exposure, the volatile temperament of the other makes any productive discussion difficult.Each issue is discussed in painstaking detail: the culpability of the boys, mitigating circumstances, even whether or not the victim was completely blame free. The brother acting as narrator looks back on his career as a teacher, his marriage, his son’s early years, and the possible influence of his nephew’s adopted brother.The book is not as mundane as all this makes it sound, far from it. But what makes it a difficult read is the unpleasant nature of the characters.An interesting read, comparisons to Gone Girl initially unlikely, do make sense </text></scrape>
