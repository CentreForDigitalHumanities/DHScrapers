I wasn't put off enough to stop reading, but that's certainly a backhanded compliment. In preparation for a trip to Holland and Belgium in the fall, I'm reading books set there or by authors from those countries. I picked this one because I keep seeing it and friends are reading it. From that perspective, I learned a bit about the Dutch, and I feel I have a little more insight into what the country is like. Now that I think about it, though, I might have dropped the book if that aspect had not been a factor in my reading. I also didn't like "Gone Girl," to which this book has been compared, either - I found them both to be contrived, somewhat unbelievable, populated with unlikable characters. </text></scrape>
