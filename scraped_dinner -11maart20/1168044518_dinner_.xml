I thought it was well written. Some things we never really "know" ... they leave some things for you to figure out or assume you know. Much much crazy in this book! I started off thinking Serge was an ass and by the end of the book, he seemed to be the only adult in the book with a lick of sense! Definitely a book that makes you think. How far would you go, as a parent, to protect your child? I think my answer definitely would be - NOT THIS FAR!!</text></scrape>
