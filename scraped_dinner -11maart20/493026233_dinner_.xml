This is his first novel to be translated into English. I'm not sure how to describe this book. It hooked me in quickly, and I enjoyed the quirky voice, and the detail of the man's observations. The characters never became fully fleshed for me though, and I became very confused about two-thirds of the way through, a confusion that wasn't really lifted by the end. Having said that, I've been thinking about it for a couple of days since, so that means it wasn't terrible. Maybe I need to read it again in a while. Herman Koch is a good writer. It would be interesting to know how it reads in Dutch - whether there are subtle cultural nuances that don't cross the language barrier, and might have made the difference to my overall appreciation of it.</text></scrape>
