I did. It was good-- to some extent, that is. I've never read any book (as far as I can remember) that gave me read rage as much as this one did. The characters are unlikable and extremely anger-inducing, I wanted to throw my phone against a wall and call it a day. But I kept turning the page, so that has got to mean something, right?</text></scrape>
