I picked it up because I heard it discussed on World Book Club as a novel analyzing the question of what constituted punishment for a crime committed by teenagers, and whether parents should turn them in or not. In fact it is a novel (and I use the word loosely) about a pair of psychopathic parents who have taught their son that violence is always a good solution to any problem. This "unfortunate incident" is no exception. In fact there is no dilemma in the book at all. Paul and his son and wife should all be in prison. I am not one of these people who needs to like the characters in a book to like that book, but the narrator Paul is so odious, obnoxious and unpleasant that it was a struggle to keep reading. Every minute in his company felt slightly icky. Mediocre writing, flat and insane characters, a so-so plot, and an overall device of questionable effectiveness. No nuance, no moral dilemma, no thought or reflection. A poor job. </text></scrape>
