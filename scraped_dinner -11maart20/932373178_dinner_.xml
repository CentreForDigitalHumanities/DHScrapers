I couldn't connect with any of the characters or their motives, since their actions were continuously more and more reprehensible. I think that the writing itself gets more than one star, the story was quick moving and did keep me wanting to find out what was going to happen, but in the end, the resolution just left me really disgusted with the entire family.</text></scrape>
