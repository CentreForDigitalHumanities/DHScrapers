Brothers Paul (unemployed teacher and the narrator) and Serge (a politician on the cusp of landing the job of Prime Minister) are out for dinner with their wives Claire (in the midst of a fight with Paul) and Babette (beautiful but fragile politician's wife). Serge has chosen the restaurant as much for his status there as for the food or the comfort and everyone is on their best behavior despite obvious tensions. As course after course arrives, tensions mount, civility is strained, and it becomes clear there is something going on between their children that has not been addressed. What began as a polite dinner devolves into heated arguments and accusations by the last course. While this family falls apart at the table Koch takes readers on a similar downward spiral. What might have seemed a simple family drama turns out to be a cover for horrifying behavior veiled in social proprieties. By the end nearly all the characters are broken and what is surprising is that everyone had seemed so normal, if not likable, at the beginning. Koch effectively skewers notions of privilege and polite society and he does it without histrionics or hyperbole. I love these excruciating books of domestic horror. That The Dinner had genuine surprises in both plot and character development put it over the edge for me. </text></scrape>
