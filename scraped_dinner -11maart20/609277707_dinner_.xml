Really, I thought, what could be so interesting about two couples having dinner at a restaurant? The joke was definitely on me. This is one of the most twisted, tense reads I've picked up in years. I consider myself a pretty astute reader of both commercial and literary fiction, but I was completely gobsmacked by the surprises in this book. The writing is lively and comic, but there's a raw undertow that sucks you into the dark corners of our most pressing social issues even when you think you're coasting along, enjoying hysterical and mostly accurate observations about the absurdity of posh dinners, politicians, social media, and bumbling educators. It isn't until about halfway through the book that you realize you're in the grip of one of the most unreliable narrators in the history of literature.</text></scrape>
