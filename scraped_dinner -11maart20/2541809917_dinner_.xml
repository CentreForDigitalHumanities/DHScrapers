There, I've said it. But I can't argue with how well this was conceived and written, with a seemingly normal beginning that devolves into terrible people doing and covering up horrible things. This book goes dark and ugly, and none of the characters has any redeeming qualities. Yet I couldn't put it down, and it made for a solid discussion.</text></scrape>
