I knew I had to eat, otherwise I would die, but I had lost my appetite."There's bit too much on the menu in this wickedly fun psychological thriller from bestselling Dutch author, Herman Koch. He's such a good writer (which comes through in the smooth translation), and his narrator is so savagely funny, insightful and demented that the entire thing goes down like an excellent meal with a slightly nasty aftertaste because of the subject matter.Two middle-aged couples dine out at an expensive Amsterdam restaurant. As they go through each extravagant, rather absurd course (presided over by a memorable restaurant manager who points at things with his pinky), we flashback to scenes involving their children. The diners are out to discuss an incident that may affect everyone's future. Despite the contrived setting (I doubt they would meet in such a bustling restaurant to talk about such a sensitive, private issue) the book is cleverly constructed. And Paul, the narrator, a former history teacher who resents his boorish older brother Serge's political sucess, plays with our sympathy. At first we are on Paul's side; his amusing, self-deprecating and cutting social observations are "razor-sharp". But as the night goes on and he fills us in on his past - and that of his wife, Claire and his son, Michel - things take a sinister turn. Then they become downright creepy and we might as well infer that Paul indeed is an unreliable narrator.The disturbing act at the centre of the book brings up a lot of ethical and moral questions, and Koch handles the teasing out of this incident brilliantly. Although he's less successful near the end where he practically rushes through the denouement. But the jagged little pieces of this narrative fits together into one horrific portrait of family life and to what extent one can go to protect their beloved.</text></scrape>
