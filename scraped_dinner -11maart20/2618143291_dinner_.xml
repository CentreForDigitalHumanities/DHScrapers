Due to the nature of the story, I did not play it while our girls were in the car with me, so I really only got a short bit of the story at any time.So at the end of the story, I was more relieved that it was over than anything. It became almost a chore, a test of my endurance... If there were ever a story that I wish I could speed up and make it go faster, this is truly it.Even though I appreciated the irony of the happy sociopathic family, it's troubling to read a book like this. It makes me question my faith in humanity. So now I need to go read something a bit more uplifting. interesting quotes (page numbers from edition with ISBN13): "Happiness needs nothing but itself. It doesn't have to be validated." (p.)"Sometimes things come out of your mouth that you regret later on. Or no, not regret. You say something so razor-sharp that the person you say it to carries it around with them for the rest of their life." (p.)</text></scrape>
