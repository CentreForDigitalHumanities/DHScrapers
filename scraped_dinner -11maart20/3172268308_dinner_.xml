It is not one that I would have come across if it had not been recommended. It was published in Holland in 2009 and not translated in to English until 2012. The plot is simple - a summer's evening in Amsterdam and two couples, Paul and Claire and Paul's brother Serge and his wife Babette, meet at a fashionable restaurant for dinner. Between bites of food and over the polite scrapings of cutlery, the conversation remains a gentle hum of polite discourse - the banality of work, the triviality of the holidays. But behind the empty words, are two families struggling to make the hardest decision of their lives. Terrible things need to be said. Over the course of one meal, with every forced smile and every new course, comes a darkly suspenseful tale.	The readers are introduced to an unsavory, shallow group of characters. Serge is running for Prime Minister in a forthcoming election and is concerned with his prospects and how things look to outsiders. His brother, Paul, is an ex-history teacher who left his job with health issues. They each have a fifteen-year-old son. The boys have been seen on CCTV footage committing an atrocity but only their families recognized them from the poor quality film. The two cousins are united by their accountability for a single horrific act. 	Courses of a meal in a restaurant are the framework for flashbacks that gradually reveal the history and relationships of those eating the meal, and of their families. With each course, we are slowly let in on the purpose of the dinner: their teenaged sons have committed a terrible crime and the adults need to talk about what can be done to protect their sons. As the story progresses, outward appearances are stripped away until eventually each character is laid bare to us in all their prejudices and flaws. Paul is the surprise, turning out to be far more complex than he gives us to believe at the beginning.	Tautly written, incredibly gripping, and told by an unforgettable narrator, The Dinner could be the topic of countless dinner party debates. Skewering everything from parenting values to pretentious menus to political convictions, this novel reveals the dark side of genteel society and asks what each of us would do in the face of unimaginable tragedy.	I can't say I really liked this book. None of the characters is sympathetic and there is too much discussion of the food itself and descriptions of the surroundings and irrelevant people to the plot. Several external issues are mentioned but never explained while the main plot extends from an initial violent act where Koch shocks us then quickly moves on to almost trivial aspects of the story. The ending seems wrong or too much out of the mood of the rest of the story. That said, the story gives much food for thought. Would you protect your child more than you would desire to uphold justice? 	The whole thing is very dark, and though it's clearly heading for a dramatic climax, it's not at all obvious what that climax will be until it arrives. Numerous times I found myself wanting to put it down, but I couldn't. As dark as it was, I wanted to know how it ended. It never became a feel good book but I was glad I read it and now I will read Koch's other novel, Summer House with Swimming Pool.  </text></scrape>
