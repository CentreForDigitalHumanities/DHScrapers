That is how I feel about The Dinner. This book should be entitled "Four Horrible People Go to A Restaurant." I hated every person in this narrative, EVERY.SINGLE.ONE. At least two of them are sociopaths, the rest are all, in some way and to varying degrees, morally bankrupt and/or disturbed. I gave it two stars instead of one because the writing is good.</text></scrape>
