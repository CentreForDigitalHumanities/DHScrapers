Every thought in his head is spiteful and condescending, and I was not looking forward to reading into the brain of an old curmudgeon. But Koch fed me just enough information, just a little taste here and there of something more, something heavier, and I was piqued. I sometimes don’t read a book’s synopsis before diving in, so I was rather surprised by the reason behind the dinner. I’m kind of glad about it because the revelation of how the heinous crime happened, floored me! How do children of happy families turn into such monsters? And then, I was fed more information, and wow. Not wanting to give the ending away, I never saw it coming and it was chilling. So good!</text></scrape>
