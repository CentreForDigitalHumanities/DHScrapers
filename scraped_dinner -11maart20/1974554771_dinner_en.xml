Two brothers and their wives meet for dinner at an over the top pretentious restaurant to discuss their children. Their sons have committed an horrific crime, and they need to decide what to do about it. That's the outline of the plot, but it really doesn't come close to describing the complexity of the story. The book is narrated by Paul, who quickly proves to be an unreliable narrator. None of the characters are likable at all, including the restaurant staff (I'm talking about you, Mr. Pinky Pointer!) The story alternates between the actual dinner and the characters' backstories and what led them to that night, although everything is told from Paul's POV. Often Paul's telling of events is very confusing, to say the least. Issues that arise in the book are: as parents how far would you go to protect your child? Or if your child commits a crime, should he/she accept responsibility?There is some satire in the book about pretentious restaurants and political posturing, which add some needed lighter moments. For me, the ending was very obscure, especially in terms of what Paul found in the desk drawer and the final scene with Michel. It felt unfinished. Or maybe I'm just obtuse. Maybe that's why it's being compared to Gone Girl (which I hated).Overall, this was a very strange book. Now I hear that it's being made into a movie. Good luck with that. I can't imagine this as a movie. Way too cerebral. I'm not sure if I recommend this book. It's just so weird. </text></scrape>
