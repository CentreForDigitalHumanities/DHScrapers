That's how I feel about this book.The writing was slow and plodding, although I did find the storytelling style itself a bit interesting. I had been wanting to read this for awhile and I was SO excited when I finally got my hands on the book. And then, well, I just kept waiting for something to happen. For ANYTHING to happen, really. But nothing really did. Well, no, that's not entirely true. Things DID happen. I'm just not entirely sure what, because the author never bothered to explain them. I understand wanting to let your readers draw their own conclusions, but this was not the way to do it. The whole premise of the story was a little weird, too. Why would you go to a fancy schmancy restaurant to discuss such intimate and personal details?Oh well.</text></scrape>
