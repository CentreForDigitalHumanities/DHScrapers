I liked the idea of a story taking place entirely throughout one evening's dinner, yet the author managed to drown out that interest with side-notes and flashbacks that made me forget what I was reading half the time. The book just didn't hold my attention or interest and by the time it was over, I had already given up. I would be willing to give Herman Koch another chance but his work is not on my mind after this one.</text></scrape>
