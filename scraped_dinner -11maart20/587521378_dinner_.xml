I loved the premise: two couples meet at a posh restaurant to discuss something of great importance that their sons (cousins) have done...or committed. Unlike the NY Times, I will not tell you too much. In this day and age, it seems parents will do practically anything, short of nothing, to protect their children's future success in academia, sports, peer popularity....that's what the crux of this book is about. However, altho I liked the book (with no great love) and I think Koch is a writer with good ideas, I don't think the delivery of this tale was effective. Whether something got lost in translation (from Dutch to English) or the weaving in and out of events past and present (before and during the dinner), as well as sometimes the characters' surprising reactions which were never quite resolved in the relation to the story, it seemed like a very jumbled story. Were there two indiscretions? What really happened at the end? I won't tell...it got mixed reviews and for good reason. What had promise to be an amazing story fell a little flat with me scratching my head and asking a million questions at the end. </text></scrape>
