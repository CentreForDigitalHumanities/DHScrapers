I really, really liked all the parts at the restaurant where Paul was just remarking on how ridiculous high-class dining was. The first time I read this I think that kind of bored me, but I liked it this time around. The rest of the plot was also great, and it's been long enough since I last read this that I still found it gripping. That being said, some of my enjoyment was taken away by knowing exactly how the plot went, so this was more of a 4-star read than a 5-star read. However, I'm still leaving my rating at 5-stars since if I hadn't known every plot point I would have definitely given this 5 stars. I doubt I'll ever re-read this, at least not in the foreseeable future, but this reminded me that I need to check out all the Herman Koch books I haven't picked up yet.Original ReviewI don't have the words to accurately describe how I feel about this book. I loved it, and it's a new favorite, but I don't know what to say about it. I'd recommend not reading any reviews on this book and going I'm blind. I think this book is best that way. This book certainly isn't for everyone, but it's not that long, so it's worth trying. Who knows, you might end up loving it like me :-)</text></scrape>
