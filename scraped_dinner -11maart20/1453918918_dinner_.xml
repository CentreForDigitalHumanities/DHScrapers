It was such an easy read. I'd be reading the next chapter before I realised. Yet I found it strangely unfulfilling when I got to the end. It seemed to advocate for violence as a reasonable resolution to life's conflicts. While I find the moral dilemma of what to do when your child commits a crime an interesting one to explore, I was left flat and found it difficult to believe the characters and their responses.
Yet I read the whole thing!
I guess it makes you think.</text></scrape>
