The novel was written in Dutch by Herman Koch, and I read an English translation by Sam Garrett. I found it an interesting and engaging read, and one that I liked more and more as I progressed though the book. In particular, I liked the ways in which I felt that the experience of reading the book paralleled the experiences of the characters. I didn’t find any of the characters particularly likeable, which I believe is intentional on Koch’s part. If you need to like at least one character in order to enjoy a novel, this book might not be for you.The novel is narrated entirely through the eyes of one of the four people at the dinner, Paul. I think that, in general, one effect of a story written in the first person is to create a sense of trust in the reader. Certainly, that was the case here. Initially, while Paul struck me as straight-talking (to the point of being abrasive), I trusted him completely. As the novel unfolded though, I trusted him less and less. Initially, I think it was (view spoiler)[his strange coyness about certain specifics of his account: the exact nature of his wife, Clare’s hospital visit, the specifics of the genetic disorder that he and Michel supposedly carry. I do not believe that such a strongly hereditary disorder exists, let alone one that is testable with an amniocentesis. This leaves me wondering whether this is a fictional illness that ‘truly’ exists within the world of the novel, or whether it exists only as a delusion by Paul. Certain other events seemed incredible to me: Paul’s assaults on Michel’s headmaster and on his brother Serge, seemed to demand much stronger consequences, had they actually taken place. My final assessment is that Paul is lying or deluded about important parts of his account and cannot be relied upon. (hide spoiler)]My loss of trust in Paul was counterpointed by the degree to which I respected (liked is too strong) Serge more and more. He seemed initially to be just a boorish and ambitious politician, but I found myself sympathising with him, and his (view spoiler)[decision to withdraw from the electoral race for the good of his family (hide spoiler)] is the noblest and most selfless action in the novel (although that’s an admittedly low bar). I thought that these (and other) shifts in my loyalty as a reader neatly mirrored the shifts in loyalty within the group gathered at the fictional table. Another intersection between narrative and metanarrative was the slow revelation of the issue that the couples have come to dinner to discuss: (view spoiler)[their sons’ murder of a homeless person (hide spoiler)]. The first third-to-a-half of the novel dances around the real issue. It’s clear that there is something very important that must be disclosed at dinner tonight, but its nature remains obscured and is released to the reader only a little at a time. I suspect that this kind of narrative striptease might really, really annoy some readers, but I thought my growing agitation at wanting the characters to spit out what they really wanted to say was a nicely uncomfortable echo of what was happening at the restaurant. Finally, the division of the narrative follows the division of the meal into courses very easily and naturally, and indeed, the reading time required for the book is very close to real-time as well. I found this construction very pleasing and satisfying.The only thing that really marred my enjoyment of The Dinner was that for a book composed very largely of interior monologue, I didn’t find Paul’s thoughts interesting or insightful enough to sustain the book, particularly in its earliest parts. This dissipated somewhat as his (as I see it) reliability diminished, but I’ll admit that I was a little disappointed by the book in its earliest parts.The Dinner is a well-executed psychological drama with an interesting construction that made me admire the way in which the story was told. I’m glad I read it and would recommend it if you like interior monologues of psychologically complex characters.</text></scrape>
