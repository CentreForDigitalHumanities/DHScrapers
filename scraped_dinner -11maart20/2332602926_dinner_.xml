I kept wanting to read and find out what happened, which is a plus, but I found the dialogue to be very forced and fake and there was nothing about the characters I found remotely redeeming. The book took dark and twisty turns that I was not anticipating. I think maybe my expectations were too high. I did enjoy the way the plot was organizized like a dinner course. While the book overall was not my favorite, others may enjoy it, particularly those who like darker plot twists with a lot of dialogue. </text></scrape>
