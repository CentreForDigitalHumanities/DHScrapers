I was curious enough to read through to the end, but never once did I feel an ounce of ... sympathy? compassion? for its main character. I had a friend who encouraged me to read it this fall (after I'd seen it surface in certain circles as a must-read) under the description that it was "like this year's Gone Girl." Not for me ... nope. There is a disturbing inciting incident, but it's written about in such a way that it all feels rather anti-climatic in the end (so, in that sense, the very OPPOSITE of Gone Girl). At any rate, not one that I loved (and it reminded me of my feelings for The Slap; while this one was set in the Netherlands, that one was set in Australia ... maybe there is something to reading books set in a foreign setting -- it never bothers me when it's, say, England, but the Dutch cultural differences added another layer of disjointedness to this one overall, making it another hurdle I struggled to get past in appreciating this title). </text></scrape>
