Just a brief inappropriate rant, for no reason at all… (view spoiler)[This is only my second Koch. Not sure how much Koch is out there, but I think I liked my first Koch better. I don't know maybe one Koch is enough? Two Koch’s too many? Can there ever really be enough Koch? Depends on who you ask :) And yes…I am aware that I am pronouncing Koch wrong “in my brain”, but my 14-year-old boy brain doesn't care, because it thinks it's funny. My brain would probably kill me if it didn't need my body for transportation. At least this Koch didn't suck. Hopefully, my painfully immature and adolescent comments have not turned you off Koch. Koch is good. Give Koch a try and stop being such a Koch blocker. Man, I really crack myself up, sometimes. If you don't like it, then I suggest you go eat a bag of Kochs. Hahaha! See...I AM funny…  (hide spoiler)]Paul and his brother Serge have a problem. Their kids have gotten into some very serious trouble and the timing couldn’t have been worse as Serge is the frontrunner to become the next Prime Minister of Holland. Looks like everyone has a plan. The fix is in. Solutions will be discussed and histories revealed alongside each of the evenings courses at The Dinner. The main course being reprehensible characters and sardonic wit.I liked it. Plenty of quote worthy material here, but ultimately not as great as Summer House with Swimming Pool for me. 3+ Stars </text></scrape>
