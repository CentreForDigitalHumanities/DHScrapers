Not in the sense that the author is fascist or anything of the sort, but rather like pointing to a certain book and recognizing that it's a feminist novel, or a queer novel, or a Southern novel, or what have you. In 'The Dinner' we have a situation in which the narrator, through a long illuminating story, reveals to the reader the picture of what a secret contempt of all things “weak” or “inferior”—formulated into an ideology and informing violent reactions—is basically, for all intents and purposes, fascist. The narrator Paul Lohman, and his wife Claire, unlikeable and repulsive that they end up being in the novel, make decisions that at first might seem unbelievable, until their history is further revealed. The fascist beliefs only become clear towards the end of the book. Interestingly, the concept of "happiness" is a running theme throughout the book. In the beginning, the narrator Paul quotes 'Anna Karenina' when he says that, "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." As Paul rails against elite society and the idea of "keeping up appearances," he and his family do just that: they believe in fictions that will keep them, on the surface, "happy." Yet, as "unhappy" and chilling realities unfold, page by page he constantly evokes how happy they are, even as the actions prove Tolstoy's claim. And, like Tolstoy warns, they are "unhappy" in a very unique way.Though, the book leaves you with an icky feeling, it is somehow very enjoyable. It might have something to do with the impulse to view the world through the eyes of someone we would never want to be. It's voyeuristic, but you can't look away. In the end, we might say to ourself, "At least I'm not THAT screwed up."</text></scrape>
