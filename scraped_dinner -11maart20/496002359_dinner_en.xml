The word has become kind of cliched to use. But, there is no other way that I can start reviewing The Dinner by Herman Koch except saying this is darkly funny and a true, true to it's core book that often relies on communicating with the reader by means of silent mental notes. Not bold words but a silent gesture that tells the reader what to except and in my opinion, that is the most powerful feature of this book.Written in Dutch by Herman Koch, translated into English by S J Watson, this book was a random pick by me at the stores. I didn't know this one, never heard of the writer. An absolute random pick and boy, did I pick a good one! Yes, I did.The story is told from the eyes of the protagonist Paul, a Dutch non-active teacher, more importantly a husband and a father. His elder brother is Serge, who is billed to be the next prime minister of Netherlands. Paul's wife claire and Serge's wife Babbete and the story revolves around all four of them while they have went out for a dinner at a respectable restaurant. A restaurant where the food is judged by quality, often that means a semi-nourished plate but not by quantity. That suits the mood, because the characters speak only when needed and the other times, it is conveyed by mental notes.Paul and Claire has a son, Michel and Rick is the son of Serge and Babbete. Serge has also adopted a child from Africa, Beau. Michel and Rick are close cousins while Beau is sort of distant. Not that they fight all the time, but somehow the bond of blood is not there. Paul cribs about it but Claire stops him always when he starts about it. And Serge and Babbete have made it clear that Beau is just their son, not any adopted son. One fine day, Michel, Rick and Beau go to a party and while returning, they decide on one last beer but don't have the money for it. So, they go to the nearest cash machine but a stinking lady, perhaps homeless lady is lying there. She doesn't move while they call out him. The biological brothers start to kick the lady, while Beau steps down. Then, the two brothers did something that later becomes part of a protest throughout the Dutch country. They did something wrong to the lady. Not something by cold blood, but more like of a childish retaliation that they couldn't get the money needed for that last beer. But they didn't notice that the ATM camera has captured their deed. Grainy, absolutely hazy but not so grainy that their parents wouldn't identify them.The rest of the story involves the two couples sitting at the restaurant, ordering a full course dinner. They discuss about trivial issues, all of them hoping that the others wouldn't bring the matter of their children. Paul and Serge has some cold blood relation between them and to Paul, Serge often appears as a person who is not fit for the post of next prime minister of the country. Because, Serge when hungry, has to eat 'NOW' even when the ladies are not in the table. He can't wait to eat. Paul becomes mentally disturbed when he sees that the next prime minister of the country will eat at the same manner among world leaders. This vicarious feeling bogs him down. Meanwhile, when the dessert appears, Serge brings the topic of their children which is now known to the entire Dutch-land. How they are going to protect their children, what can be done. Claire bursts out in disagreement with Serge and decides that either Paul, who has known records of violent behaviour has to do something that will hold Serge to appear from the press conference where he is planning to redeem himself of guilt. But, Paul is not so sure. In the meantime, they get to know that Beau is also engaged somehow with the crime that Michel and Rick have committed. Not in a pleasant way but in a way that can only endanger the cousins. This book is about love, about blind love. How far can parents go protect their own children, how closely they hold their family - even if that makes them appear like a psychotic. Gripping story, almost as delicate as the food, as nimble as the choice of the main course, this book will not let you disappointed. Sometimes, the plot seems a bit far-away where Paul goes to describe his counters with Serge or what he feels about his son but all those bits and pieces finally fit together to reach the conclusion. They don't describe love for their children as loudly and as vividly as the restaurant manager describes the food but the subliminal care and the picturesque representation of the characters is what makes this book a stand out.Not a one which should be missed. It deserves a place in your book shelf. 4 starts out of 5 and yes this book demands it.</text></scrape>
