The premise is promising; two brothers and their wives are to meet for a dinner, but what transpires is so dark and so ugly that I am a loss for words. It is definitely true that such people exist, as we see every day if we watch the news, but to have their layers peeled away like this was extremely unsettling. I am thinking of that old saying that 'love is the other side of hate" and this book illustrates that thought perfectly. It is frightening to imagine that there exists a family that is so self preserving that it would act as a unit to eradicate all threats to their existence. Each and every member of this family is as disturbed as the other and actually applauds its efforts to keep their status quo.I am eager to move on to another book, one that teaches me something useful or entertains me and lets me get away from this sort of meanness!</text></scrape>
