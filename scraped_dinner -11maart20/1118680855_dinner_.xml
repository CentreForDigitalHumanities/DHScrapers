The first thing I noticed was the way it was written. It felt very awkward. I can't help but wonder if the person who translated the book from Dutch did a really crappy job or if the author is to blame.
The characters (all of them) are absolutely detestable. The story is boring, I found myself skipping whole paragraphs which is something I usually never do. All in all, it was just a bad read.</text></scrape>
