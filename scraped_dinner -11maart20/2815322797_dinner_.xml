Typical chatter, and then, things take a turn as they discuss their sons.

This book felt promising for me, but about mid way through the book, it derailed and I felt slowed down. The dialogue seemed hokey in what is equivalent to a shifty eye of a suspect in a tv mystery.

Relationships between spouses, but also parents vs. children, are analyzed and flushed out. Good premise, but just fell a bit flat for me.</text></scrape>
