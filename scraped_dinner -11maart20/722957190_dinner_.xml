At first, I thought there was something about the translation that just didn't make for a smooth read. But apparently, I am not the only one who thought it was a bit stilted.I also did not like how the narrator would mention something that happened only to say that he will not expand on it. Why mention it then?The characters were psychopaths. Serge had selfish reasons himself for turning his son in, but at least he was doing the right thing. I understand that not every parent would agree. Perhaps if my son is ever in this predicament, I won't be as righteous. But most especially, what really got to me was the "psychological disorder" that the narrator has. SPOILER ALERT! IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK, STOP READING MY REVIEW NOW!!I have a son who has autism. Not Asperger's. But I know enough about it that when the narrator mentions his disorder named after a German neurologist, I didn't automatically think of AS. I actually looked up what other disorders there are. Because people with AS are not thugs. They are not violent the way this narrator is. There was nothing about this character that pointed to anything that showed him having Asperger's. Not even the stereotypical descriptions of being intelligent, obsessive-compulsive, a stickler for rules and order, etc. The only thing that he got right is the incorrect stereotypical assumption that people with Asperger's are not empathic and are indifferent to human suffering. Oh he better wish that he never ends up suffering at the hospital and the only doctor he can find has AS.Turns out, the author did think about naming it Aspergers, but didn't want to deal with all the discussions that would come later, so he didn't bother. Meaning, he clearly did not do or could not be bothered to do research!! You cannot find it through amniocentesis if they have this disorder like it mentions it the book, nor can you conclusively pass it on to your offspring. But according to the author, he did consult an expert and was told that it is NOT possible to find this disorder in a person's DNA. To which he decided to add anyway to the book as 'science fiction'.This book made me want to punch someone in the face.</text></scrape>
