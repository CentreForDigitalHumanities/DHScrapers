I was caught up in the mystery, but was soon distracted by what an a-hole the narrator turned into. The characters were really unlikeable, which I do not enjoy in a book. But it was a quick read, and I quickly devoured it to find out what the mystery was all about. When the truth was finally revealed, I felt less shocked than annoyed. The family dynamics and the myopic obsession with children of these people was just inexplicable to me. I found the characters unrealistic and incomprehensible.</text></scrape>
