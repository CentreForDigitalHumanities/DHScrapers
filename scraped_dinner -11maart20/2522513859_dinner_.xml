Weird, interesting structure that jumped back and forth; kinda hard to keep up with. There was no real reasoning behind any of the characters’ actions, and you pretty much end up hating all them. A lot of the events didn’t make sense. 3* because at least I was able to finish this book.</text></scrape>
