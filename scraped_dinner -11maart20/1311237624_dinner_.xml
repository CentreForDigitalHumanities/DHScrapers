That's not always true for a book that contains as much shock value as this one does-- there are definitely some jaw dropping moments and big surprises. Usually, once the surprise of the initial shock is gone the book loses its luster, but 'The Dinner' packs more of a wallop than just violence & suspense.The events of the book take place entirely at a dinner, with each section labeled as "appetizer", "main course" and so on. Our narrator is very unlikeable and completely unreliable, so we are left to piece together what may have actually occurred through his warped perspective. At the heart of the story, and the reason for the titular dinner, is an act of horrific violence committed by the children of the couples meeting. 'The Dinner' is a meditation on family, violence, and inheritance. Overall, a book with both substance and speed.</text></scrape>
