As the evening goes on, it becomes apparent that there are many secrets between them all and within their own families.Their sons have committed serious crimes, together.Koch ends the book revealing more secrets but also adding a surprising twist at the end.I had be thinking of using this for my book club group because of the many topics we could discuss.This book will be one I will be discussing and thinking about which does make it a good book.The background story was rather long and drawn out which is why I gave the score of 3/5.</text></scrape>
