My punny heart rejoices.Now on to potentionally more important stuff.One of those notorious modern classics that tend to show up in your conscious awareness now and then, I was surprised this was published as recently as 2009, with this translation being from 2012.I always assumed this was at least from the 90s.This was such a solid, well-rounded read featuring a whole load of unforeseeable turns and a slightly unreliable narrator.Just great to devour during daytrips, as I nearly did. (Finished the last chapters after said daytrip, greatly engrossed.)It's very uncomfortable at times and man, whatever Herman Koch did in this, he did it really well.A gripping book for sure, as overused as that sentence is, The Dinner truly is a feast.(Please note that I myself think my puns are horrible too, not by any means clever or anything haha, but that's also half the fun amirite)</text></scrape>
