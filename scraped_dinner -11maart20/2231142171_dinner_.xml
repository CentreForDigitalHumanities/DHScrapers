This well drawn out book reads like we get to know someone in many ways. At first you see a person as you think they are, you find ways you relate to them, you give them the benefit of the doubt. But over time you begin to see things underneath that give you a more full picture of who they are. Sometimes you like that picture and sometimes it is too much to keep up the connection with them. Koch draws you into the story of these two brothers and their families in that same way. Taking place over dinner one evening, two brothers and their wives meet to discuss a life-changing decision regarding their children. He has done an excellent job of developing the story and creating characters who are relatable and yet horrifying. What would you do to protect your children? Where does the responsibility lie when a young person does unspeakable things? Do children act based on nature or nurture or a combination of both? How well do you really know those around you and what they are capable of? Fans of books with twists and turns, glimpses into the underlying motivations of people and the ways in which the same human can be both loving and cruel will find this a good choice!</text></scrape>
