The pace of the story was so choppy, with most of the book being told in a stream-of-consciousness of Paul's thoughts and recollections. There was not enough of the real story interjected to move the mystery along. And I would never want to spend one minute, much less one evening, with ANY of these characters. Yech.</text></scrape>
