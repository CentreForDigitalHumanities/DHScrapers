The author does such a good job in deep diving their personalities and their pasts... and then you think you really know someone. But do you?It is also an accomplishment for an author to take a storyline that takes place mostly in a short few hours and make them so engrossing. Especially since the first 35% of the book - literally says my Kindle - is purely supposed to be nonchalant dinner activities. But it isn’t. Every detail in this book was meaningful to its outcome.There are, of course, flashbacks. They are not overwhelming but perfectly crafted within the story to add to the scene you see unfolding at the dinner table. Little crumbs the author leaves here and there only further the character development and show you that you can’t always go with your first impression.You will even find yourself in a precarious position. What would YOU do? How would YOU react? You may switch sides around the middle of the book...And at the end you will be both shocked and not, yet satisfied with a very well told story.</text></scrape>
