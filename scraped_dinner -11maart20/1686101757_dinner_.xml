I can't really say I got four stars' worth of enjoyment out of this book, but I have to give credit for the author's style. I read it in a little over a day, absolutely could not stop.The story takes place over dinner in an upscale restaurant, attended by two brothers -- one of them a candidate for high office -- and their wives. I was enthralled by the way the author fills in the backstory (involving both couples' children) in bits and pieces over the course(s) of the dinner.My feelings toward each of the characters were on a roller coaster -- ranging from admiration to sympathy to intense dislike to horror, and back again.This one will stay with me a while; both story and style are unique.</text></scrape>
