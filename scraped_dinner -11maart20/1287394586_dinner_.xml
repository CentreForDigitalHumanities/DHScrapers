The narrator is downright unlikable, but as I read on I understood better who he was and why he was so unlikable. As other reviewers have said, it makes you think about parents and children and how far should parents go to protect their children, as well as other subjects such as the challenges of cross-cultural adoptions.</text></scrape>
