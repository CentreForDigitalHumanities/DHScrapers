This is a dark Dutch variant, quite claustrophobic. Two couples get together for dinner at an Amsterdam restaurant. The men are brothers, and as the novel unfolds more and darker details emerge around family secrets. Would be a good read for a discussion, and was also a good read for a plane ride, as it happens.</text></scrape>
