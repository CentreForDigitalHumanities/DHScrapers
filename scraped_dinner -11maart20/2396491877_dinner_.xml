Absolutely worst translation of a book into English Iâ€™ve ever read. Switching between English and American for school related matters. Calling it elementary school, later using A as marks them swooping to the continental numbers. Using football and soccer when as the same term. The whole book just not saying anything, not giving anything a name... not to speak of a parent promoting their child to kill a cousin and cover it up. </text></scrape>
