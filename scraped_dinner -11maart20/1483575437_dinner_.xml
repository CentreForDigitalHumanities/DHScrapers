At no point did I care about any of the characters or what happened to them. In fact, I may have been rooting for every single one of them to die miserable deaths just so they could cease to exist on the pages. Truly one of the worst books I have read in a very long time. To top it off, either the author uses the phrase in Dutch, or the translator included it oddly, but "above all" is used way too often and in strange contexts. It was distracting.</text></scrape>
