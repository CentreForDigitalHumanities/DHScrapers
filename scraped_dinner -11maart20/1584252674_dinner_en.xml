"I thought of you!"She knows me too well.Unfortunately, the person who wrote that blurb is Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl and the person who, while a TV critic for Entertainment Weekly, gave Lisa Kudrow's The Comeback a C. She is a competent author, but she has questionable judgment and taste when it comes other's work. Seriously, Gillian, a C?! It's been 11 years. I will never forget.The Dinner is a contrived novel about bored rich people whose bored rich children commit an awful crime, yet their bored rich parents can only complain about every middling aspect of their dinner at a restaurant that probably costs more than most people make in an entire month. Everyone is a one-dimensional whiny asshole, and all their problems are self-imposed. Flynn also calls the book "smart" and "unputdownable," my least favorite book-review buzzword. Creating characters who are simply rude, disgusting people who make snide remarks about everything isn't smart; it's simplistic. So I put the book down. I will say the book is "nasty," but that still leaves Flynn only 1 for 5. 20% isn't even a C, Gillian.Another blurb says, "By the end of The Dinner you'll have to rethink everything, including who you are and what you believe." I didn't finish it, but I went into this book thinking that self-absorbed entitled assholes are assholes, and this book only confirmed it. Reading The Dinner would be like attending a dinner with all the people on Facebook whom you consider unfriending on a regular basis. </text></scrape>
