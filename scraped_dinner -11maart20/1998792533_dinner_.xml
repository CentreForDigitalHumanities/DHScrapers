Despite rave reviews and personal recommendations from people whose literary taste (and knowledge of mine) I fully trust, I couldn't help but wonder if it's not just some sort of rehash of The God of Carnage. It's not. Sure, the premise seems dangerously similar: two pairs of parents meet to discuss their children. But Koch takes it in a completely different direction in both subject and tone.I loved everything about this book. I loved the pacing of the action, the swings between past and present, and the reveal of crucial moments. I loved the contrasts: between the characters themselves, between their thoughts and words, between expectations and reality. I loved the character build, especially as the layers are progressively peeled back. (You might argue that Serge appears flatter than the others, but I thought that makes perfect sense, seeing how he's described and "interpreted" by his brother through the lens of strong negative feelings. I mean, maybe Serge is more complicated, but we don't get to see it because Paul's telling the story, and I'm more than fine with that.) I loved the dry, lucid, biting sarcasm with which the narrator analyses everything; I found it somewhat contrived at first, but then "got it" (view spoiler)[once Paul's history of mental issues becomes apparent (hide spoiler)].
  The first thing that struck you about Claire's plate was its vast emptiness. Of course I'm well aware that, in the better restaurants, quality takes precedence over quantity, but there are voids and then there are voids. The void here, that part of the place on which no food at all was present, had clearly been raised to a matter of principle.
(This isn't the best quote. I just got so caught up I even forgot to underline.)Despite loving it, I realize it might not be for everyone. It's not a feel-good book by any stretch of the imagination. So approach with caution. But if you like it, I probably like you.[Does not fit into the PopSugar Reading Challenge 2017]</text></scrape>
