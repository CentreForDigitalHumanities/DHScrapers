I don’t share the view that this is a suspenseful novel, in that the main plot developments can be seen coming from a fairly early stage in proceedings (particularly if you’ve read the irritatingly spoiler-heavy professional reviews). However, the characters are cleverly developed and the author is confident enough to hold a lot back, with some of the most important issues never fully spelt out or even directly acknowledged. There seems to be a consensus among other reviewers that the characters are largely unlikable. For my part, I found myself relating to and increasingly rooting for the most violently sociopathic member of the central quartet. Not sure if that says more about me or the book. </text></scrape>
