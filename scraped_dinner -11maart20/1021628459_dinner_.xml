From reading the description, I knew there would be a horrible reveal at some point. At the beginning, my heart was racing and I lost track of my surroundings as I read, eager to find out what the kids did. But, then it began to jump around and the reveal was somewhat of a let down and I found myself skimming at times. It almost seemed like two completely different books and the character development was lacking (perhaps it was lost in translation. I found myself suddenly feeling no sympathy for the narrator and actually despised him by the end). Not sure it was worth the read...I feel like I was cheated out of a great read since the beginning was so good.</text></scrape>
