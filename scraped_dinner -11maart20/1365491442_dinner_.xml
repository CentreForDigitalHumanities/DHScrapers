With little inflections and lilts, Mantle captures all of the contempt and disdain that oozes out of this book. It is a commanding performance.Mantle’s reading, and the book’s content and tone, reminded me almost immediately of Jeremy Iron’s performance of Lolita. As in Lolita, The Dinner is recounted to us through the eyes of an elitist and sociopathic narrator, in this case Paul Lohman who, like Humbert in Lolita, dishes out his narcissistic scorn for pretty much everything and everyone around him. I had the same discomfort about Lohman that I did with Humbert, with their morally distorted justifications of themselves and their actions. Very unsettling.And not much is spared Lohman's vitriol. He takes on the Dutch, his boorish politician brother, the rigid standards of the education system, the superciliousness of the fine restaurant and staff in which the book takes place, the pretentiousness of our social interactions and norms. Lohman's acidic rantings immediately define our opinion of him, our dislike instantaneous.The story centers around a dinner meeting between Paul, his brother Serge, and their wives Claire and Babette, ostensibly to talk about a horrible murder committed by their children. Herman Koch unfolds this story gradually and masterfully, serving us snippets and little hints that create tension and keep us on unsure footing, building all the while the conflict and strain between the characters, which is always reflected and filtered through our narrator Paul. And it all gets darker as the book progresses, with an ending that shocks and horrifies.And throughout, there is the sense of the unreliable narrator. There are so many inconsistencies. Did this all really happen, or are these the distorted delusions of our perhaps mentally ill narrator, Paul? And what should we say about Claire, who we also see only through Paul’s eyes? Is she the partner? The arbiter? The architect? It’s all rather hard to tell. Except for the strength of her defense of family. And what about this notion of family? How far will a parent go in the defense of the children? Are there moral lines to be drawn? We see these issues explored in disquieting detail in this difficult dinner drama.So in the end, disturbing, nuanced and very well crafted, The Dinner was an easy 5 star rating for me.</text></scrape>
