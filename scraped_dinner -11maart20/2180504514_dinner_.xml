It's three stars because I disliked it intensely. The characters were hateful and the situation in the restaurant contrived. The parents are supposed to be demonstrating the extent to which they will go to protect their child but come across as completely selfish, self centred rather than have the self sacrifice that characterises parental love. I read for enjoyment or to learn something (about myself or life). All I learned from this book was to very, very careful next time in Holland.</text></scrape>
