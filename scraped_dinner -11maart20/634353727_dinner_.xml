The good news is that my book club will have read both of these books so it will be interesting to compare. The book is set in the Netherlands, but could really be anywhere (no fault of the author....most of it takes place over one dinner in an upscale restaurant). Definitely an interesting study on the nature of psychopathy, and a page turner, but I wanted to like it more than I did, I guess....meaning I wanted to adore it, and ended up just liking it. </text></scrape>
