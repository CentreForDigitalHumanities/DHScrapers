Like, what the heck did I just read? I can't believe this "story" got put down on paper, approved and published AND is being made into a movie. A rich man and his rich wife go to a dinner with his richer brother and sister in law. Their sons are keeping an atrocious secret and that becomes the topic to not discuss. The characters are appalling and heinous, and the parents are crap. No real development and when there is a chance, the main character tells us he won't tell us about it. Bravo, Koch, if your goal was to write a book that people will throw in the garbage or use as kindling because to keep it around as a book would be a disrespect to all other books, you have succeeded. </text></scrape>
