The novel, told from the perspective of Paul Lohman, begins with the couple meeting for dinner with plenty of Paul’s opinions. I was tempted to put the novel done as I found Paul boorish, but I’m glad I made it to the midway point when the purpose for the dinner is revealed. I don’t want to tell you too much about what the kids did, but their actions and the actions of everyone at that table are fascinating and disturbing. </text></scrape>
